Not uploading GIF, I agree with.
But I **bet**, this is a fun little conflict in Fastly rules and mediaserver expectations.
IMO, this is worth resolving.  There‚Äôs a weird set of fallout that I think could occur here, because other things will have WEBP sources that should be correctly downgraded anyway.{quote}","17/Apr/19 1:08 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;{quote}gav [1:00 PM]
Speaking of: https://jira.ihrint.com/browse/IHRAR-5565 is actually a bigger issue than originally thought.

I mean, it‚Äôs not a backwards-incompatible issue.
Short version: if you send an image request with no `?ops=` anything, then the auto-formatter doesn‚Äôt apply, and it just serves whatever the original format of the image is.

It was this way before we added WEBP, so this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmore wrong‚Äù.

Mike Woodruff [1:02 PM]
i think the number of uses where no ops are supplied is limited - at least on our user-facing apps

gav [1:06 PM]
I‚Äôd be willing to believe that.
We just need to eliminate the alternate path and have all requests go through the image pipeline, and everything should behave.

but if there‚Äôs hundreds of these stations like this, I can‚Äôt do all of that manually

Mike Woodruff [11:43 AM]
do you know when the genre for affected stations was last correctly returned in the API?

no

rashad [11:43 AM]
no idea

WOJO is showing up fine in the latino directory for Chicago, so that‚Äôs working fine
taking the primary genre and placing it in the directories properly

rashad [11:46 AM]
so is WOJO fixed now? it definitly didnt have a genre marked as primary when i checked

Mike Woodruff [11:47 AM]
wojo doesn‚Äôt seem to have a primary genre set in the API
what is the user-facing impact of this issue?

rashad [11:52 AM]
the stations are not as searchable. or easy to find in search
if someone is looking for one of these stations by their genre, they wont be searchable
which is possible

Mike Woodruff [11:53 AM]
hmm, KGO comes up no problem when i search for it, even without a primary genre

# Change highlight color for scheduled streams to something other than red so they don't appear expired/inactive
# Re-work Scheduled fill screen to reflect how stations are scheduled individually.  List view?  Bigger images?  Or, remove screen in its entirety and add a cancel button to the main streams screen so you can add and remove in one place?

So, the problem with Bell is it's all external content, and we now require blocks for articles, so it's failing validation. Ideally external content would be its own template type that didn't have that requirement, but since that probably breaks others things, the short-term hack is to either bypass that requirement in the legacy generator for pubsub, or make the content valid by adding a block to it that wouldn't ever be read.

# Most WebAPI data is additive. It's better to get what we can quickly and error on the rest. WebAPI will add a 5s timeout on all external data requests. (IHRAR-5436)
# Web has a server-based timeout for WebAPI requests of 3s. This should be extended so it is longer than WebAPI's timeout. Web to implement a 5.5s timeout on server to webapi calls. (WEB-13330)
# WebAPI doesn't cache error responses from external data requests. This means if external services are temporarily unavailable, it will spam the service trying to get a response. WebAPI will add  a 60s cache to errors. (AR-5436)
# During the last episode when web was having trouble with 500's caused by WebAPI, we spent a long time trying to track down the problem. It turns out web was erroring on 5s+ webapi responses, but since the webapi response eventually completed successfully, the webapi charts didn't show any errors.

This is going to be another link in the left of the screen.

The goal of this ticket is two-fold... first to see which stations have fill scheduled - and to remove from a station/stations that should no longer have it.

Would like users to be able to see active and/or future fills.  Thinking for completeness we might consider adding recent/past fills as well, though not sure how much utility this would bring.

Or, do we consider a date chooser instead - that users can choose either a single date - or a date range - and we show all stations that have a holiday fill active at the time?

Can users change the fill dates from this screen, or do they have to delete and setup a new one if they goofed the date?

While the Streams implemented functionally matches what was in the old AdsWizz tool, it's not a desirable workflow.  Created IHRAR-5501 to implement the workflow that would more closely meet business requirements.

For this particular ticket, let's iron out the following and we'll move to done:

# Change left nav text to ""Scheduled Fill"" to minimize confusion with the ""Holiday Fill"" button on the main page.
# Add a ""Scheduled Fill"" title to the top of this page
# Add the callsign  (eg. WHTZ-FM) to each item, in addition to the stream ID currently shown (and allow for search by that call sign in the search box)
# Fix style issue on the Cancel button so it's always in the box and doesn't cover up the date","03/Apr/19 8:31 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Re-tested on stage.  Nav looks good, title looks good, call sign looks good, cancel button looks good.

Worth a try at least. Most likely what happened is because we were completely remaking the index for the cluster switch, some fields got registered as numeric types that weren't before, and elastic throws out the documents that have strings in that field
There's no reason really to have elastic mappings for the ""fields"" portion of content items, so the fix is to disable automatic mapping for that portion of the document

ok, get a ticket opened and schedule it. It‚Äôs at least a 2, because each SiteFunctions resolver would need to check to see if it is in the context of a genre before looking at args for a SiteQuery.
because it _seemed_ like overkill for what was being asked for
literally everything in there is in the site config, which is why I returned a site config
and technically you could get the query out of the site config, and use that to query for content
but I understand wanting all of the SiteFunctions exposed
once you have a brand, you want to be able to query for anything you can query for at the root level by brand

that resolver just needs to be coded up in such a way that it can be called independently or in the context of another resolver

It is believed that the root cause of these errors were expired session tokens caused by the tool being left open for days on end.  Access tokens expired after a day, and if a user tried to write a change to the tool (such as a server save or publish), the server would reject the change as the session was expired and display a vague error message.

To alleviate this, the following changes were made on this ticket:

1) While open, the tool pings the server every 5 minutes to verify the token is valid and if expired, fetches a new one.  This will continue for up to 6 days, after which a user will be completely logged out of RadioEdit and will need to log back in due to the platform-wide session limit.
2) If the user has been logged out (either because they hit the 6 day limit, logged out of the tool in another window, or went offline, the error messaging has been enhanced to clarify that the save failed because the user is not logged in - and directs them to login by refreshing the page.  Because edits are stored locally, a refresh would not remove content that wasn‚Äôt successfully saved to the server.

We do have some other tickets in the AR backlog to further investigate reported save failures, but believe the changes made here will address the symptoms reported here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. There is an angular way to change the title. Will look into this.

3. On delete, we can back up drafts. Adding undelete for these drafts seems like overkill. Investigate some kind of breadcrumb software.

5. If they can't click a save button, they don't deserve to have their data saved. We _could_ store drafts in a separate spot on the server, but it seems like a lot of complexity for so little gain.

6. This is worth it to just ticket and knock out if it will provide useful data. RUM inside Raygun provides similarly useful data as well, so we should get radioedit support into Raygun. User tracking needs to be fixed, and we should see if we can fire some custom events.

7. We can replace the url. Increase audit time to prevent aggressive searches, and only for searches. Move auditTime from router event to search box.

We have a cluster-wide event that has a respective cluster-wide feature page. Linking to the feature page as a relative link (/featured/corks-carts/) works from the image in the content tool, but does not work as a text hyperlink.

On this Calendar page, which is on all 10 Portland sites, the image is set to link to /featured/corks-carts/, which works, but both the the CORKS + CARTS hyperlink and the EVENT DETAILS hyperlink in the text (also set to link to /featured/corks-carts/) links to the page on K103.

Spike: How To Prevent Massive Animated GIF Thumbnails From Impacting Homepage Load Time,IHRAR-5340,660486,Story,Submitted,AR,,,MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com,MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com,2/19/19 11:50,2/26/19 8:26,,,Mediaserver,,,,,,,"The Houston market has started using Animated GIFs as thumbnail images in the content tool.

While the animation does add a nice visual touch, it absolutely kills site load time.  

At the moment, MediaServer is doing no processing on GIF images since when we tried to do this before, it killed system performance. (I think this was done in late 2016 when the national photo team was using animated gifs, but it seems the work was not tracked in JIRA)

[~gvilches] mentioned that pluck() will accomplish this goal, but since GIFs are currently bypassing mediaserver in their entirety, that won't solve the problem at present.  

Is there a way we can allow users to upload an animiated gif for the desired effect in the actual content page (and off-platform destinations) but not let it kill our homepage/collection page load times?  Would beefing up the processing power on MediaServer allow this, or do we need to consider excluding a gif mimetype in the thumbnail/primary image field in content tool and leads?

Original description that Trey commented on above for posterity:

{quote}There's been some feedback about the default (30 day) end date we apply to content items when a user disables the ""Live Immediately"" option.

A few months ago, we set this as 30 days based on user feedback that the then-default end date of ""6/6/00"" was confusing and that the most of the time users would use this option for limited duration content (such as a concert presale code, weekend promotion, etc).

It seems in practice that it's being used more commonly to pre-write content that is to go live in the overnight hours or during the weekend, and that having the 30 day default end date is annoying to users as they have to manually clear it out.

What would it take to clear the end date when live immediately is disabled by default (knowing that upon publish with a blank end date, we apply 6/6/2100)?

Can we also change the date to show the full YYYY to minimize confusion about why something appears to have an end date of 19 years ago?{quote}","25/Feb/19 9:49 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Tested on stage.

{quote}mattbrown [10:42 AM]
So, the problem with Bell is it's all external content, and we now require blocks for articles, so it's failing validation. Ideally external content would be its own template type that didn't have that requirement, but since that probably breaks others things, the short-term hack is to either bypass that requirement in the legacy generator for pubsub, or make the content valid by adding a block to it that wouldn't ever be read.  Probably the bypass option is easiest

Perhaps we can investigate ways to solve for ""dead"" embeds. Adding full previews into the editor has always been problematic and hurts performance.","20/Feb/19 5:05 PM;MattBerger@iheartmedia.com;[~aroberts] The national editors don't seem to be concerned about how displaying the full-size embeds will hurt the performance of the editor. Most articles have only 2-3 embeds so the slower performance is minimal compared to the benefit of being able to see the full-size embed while creating/editing the article.  For larger ""listicles"" with many embeds the slower performance will be noticeable and we can consider lazy loading the content blocks in the future.","29/Mar/19 10:30 AM;AdamRoberts@iheartmedia.com;This is a complicated topic, but the full sized embeds were removed for several significant reasons. Performance being one, but also a number of these embeds require scripts from instagram/facebook/whoever for them to render properly, and are not meant to be rendered over and over on a page. So as an editor is changing things and choosing new items it becomes increasingly difficult to make sure all the scripts have run when they need to. We're also introducing a host of third party scripts into an already complex page. Iframes can help with some of this, but then we have problems with preview heights etc because due to browser security restrictions we can't access the content of those iframe etc etc etc. This was tried to not amazing success in the last iteration of content. Engineering recommends against it.","29/Mar/19 10:35 AM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;Adam is correct. We tried in the last tool and it caused quite a few issues. Not the least being that there was a never ending amount of 3rd party embeds to add, fix, change and support.

There is an existing way to preview the article in the form of the preview button. Perhaps a solution exists in how and when we show the preview.",29/Mar/19 10:45 AM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;[~aroberts] the second screenshot shouldn't be how we handle that. There should be more and better organized information about the embeds since they are deferred.,,,,,,,,,

Yudi [2:36 PM]
why are we querying :all_the_things:  up front...?

gav [2:37 PM]
Because the way the original tool owners designed the search facility, we didn't have search capabilities that could address that back then on the ObjectDB side.
So we had to load everything in and search client-side.

can we ticket a fix for that? @Mike Woodruff?

Mike Woodruff [2:39 PM]

trey [2:39 PM]
From a platform ownership standpoint, I think a slow load should be expected here. I‚Äôm not sure what variance there has been in the past but our metrics don‚Äôt show any slowdowns that I can see. Most likely a local network dependency.

Yudi [2:40 PM]
@trey agreed that querying for everything all at once should be expected to be slow, but it was slower than usual. Either way now that the capability exists to query only the necessary items, it seems that would be the way to go to fix it entirely

Here‚Äôs the search rules as they currently stand: Every search term (space separated) must match one of: ‚ÄúID‚Äù, ‚Äútitle‚Äù, ‚Äúauthor‚Äù .  All keywords must match, and there‚Äôs also a separate filter for the playlist type that must be included as well in AND form.  That second filter must also account for a user‚Äôs taxonomy information.
And they don‚Äôt want any empty pages, so they don‚Äôt want any results returned that don‚Äôt account for that user having the correct tags to see that type of filter.
The words must be allowed to be submatches.  So ‚Äúbo‚Äù would match everything that has ‚Äúbo‚Äù *anywhere* inside of it.


Example: a search for ‚Äú000‚Äù should return:  (you can see it‚Äôs sometimes in the ID, sometimes in the title)

walk me through, high level on the playlist token change please

right?

Yudi [3:47 PM]
more or less, yes

Mike Woodruff [3:48 PM]
is the token stored in the same location as before?
or will we want to clear those env variables upon release to minimize confusion?

Yudi [3:49 PM]
There's a backend service that keeps track of the current session token, in the server memory (so, no longer in Developer). I wouldn't clear it just yet since i haven't tested what happens if that is removed.

Before anything is called that writes to AMP, we test with that current session token. If it's bad, then the server logs in again using the username/password that is set in Developer, gets a new token, and then stores/uses that. If it's good, it goes ahead with the current token.

This repeats every time someone tries to save a playlist to AMP.
all end users are sharing the same token, which gets rid of that 9-person-limit that people were worried about

Mike Woodruff [3:50 PM]
ok, that makes sense.  And I saw your followup ticket to do the same on delete/unpublish

Yudi [3:50 PM]
yes. Those should most likely work just fine, and if they don't then you can just hit publish on anything in order to refresh the token. However to update those particular methods to do the same verification is a pretty intensive process since a lot of it has to be refactored.{quote}",,,,,,,,,,,,

Okay, so, there‚Äôs good news and mediocre news.
Good news is that whatever Yudi saw seems to be temporary.  It hasn‚Äôt hung for me once.
Mediocre news is that staging images won‚Äôt show anyway.
*Because*
Since we‚Äôve switched off of Akamai, the way we used to handle uploading images in staging for testing purposes doesn‚Äôt work anymore.

Production works fine, because it‚Äôs different than staging from the serving perspective.
Unsurprisingly as you might expect.
If you want workarounds put in place to handle staging image handling, it‚Äôs doable.  it‚Äôs just never been prioritized.
I can test this in prod on a test show easy enough to verify if I‚Äôm correct, but I know we‚Äôve had this issue before, and was considered not worth making a ticket over.

I get being able to specify a ""main"" feed for use throughout the site (eg. homepage, 404 page, other places where we show the ""main content), but i think it should probably be labeled ""Default Feed"" to minimize confusion about users thinking that it would only be used on the homepage.  This would also match up to the ""Default Podcasts"" and ""Default Content Topics"" shown in the same area.

I can't think through what the topic page feed would be used for.  Where are we thinking of using this downstream?

Once selected, where would this default feed be used?  Assuming on the page block level, but thinking that we need to add the ""use default"" functionality that we have for collection and podcast blocks to allow users to choose between the value set at the site level - or choose a different feed for the individual page.  Unsure if this should be done in this ticket, or if the work's captured elsewhere.",20/Mar/19 9:23 AM;MarkCahill@iheartmedia.com;It *would* only be used on the home page.

These are the datasources that web will use once we implement data sources.,"20/Mar/19 9:51 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Let's chat about this after standup.

I think the goal of this should be to allow users to specify a site-level default feed that can be used across multiple pages - similar to what default content topics does for collection blocks (which also powers timeline RSS and web's live profile editorial module) or default podcasts does for podcast blocks (which powers the forthcoming Podcast module on web's live profiles).

I want to make sure however we approach this, it's consistent with how users are familiar with the tool working so there's not a different workflow thy need to learn.","20/Mar/19 10:32 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Discussed after standup today with the team.  We need to do the following on this ticket:

# Remove ""Default Topic Page Feed""
# Rename ""Default Home Page Feed"" to ""Default Feed""
# Change ""Default Feed"" help text to ""The primary feed used throughout the site""

Confirmed that the 2nd feed selector has been removed and that the title now says Default Feed.  Noted that the help text is not what I listed above, but if engineering things what's there is more clear, I'm fine with it.

Confirmed that the feed value selected survives a save.  Note, there is no provision to blank the default feed value - but I can't offhand think of any use cases where we'd need to do this.  This looks good to me.",,,,,,,,

Spike: Why Are Playlist Permissions So Different From Content/Leads?,IHRAR-5166,658143,Story,Completed,AR,Completed,GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com,MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com,MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com,1/16/19 15:06,2/15/19 9:19,2/11/19 15:55,2019.2.12,Playlist,,,,,AR_Kanban,,"We've had several tickets (IHRAR-4371, AR-4372, AR-4701, AR-4934) to implement a permission system in the playlist tool to facilitate rollout to local users.  Unfortunately, from my testing, what is there now isn't consistent with what our users are used to.

The original ask was to implement a permission system akin to what's in Content (and to some extent Leads) where users with access to the playlist too can see everything and only edit those playlists they have permission to via an editor tag (using a brand, market, or provider).

The following things look good in my understanding of the current implementation, as reviewed on Stage:

# There's an editor field in the playlist metadata screen where a brand or provider can be tagged
# Users can see all playlists regardless of which editor is tagged on a playlist
# Users can filter between all playlists and those which they can edit
# Users are blocked from editing playlists they don't have permission to.

The following things don't look right:

# The editor field gets bloated with excessive tags that will confuse users (eg. resource, user, users, _public, user/system/everyone, etc.  Only the specifically-applied brand/market/provider tag should be shown in there.
# Editor field is not required, it can be saved without any tags which could orphan a playlist (though it does seem to add ""resource"", which after refresh allows editing by ??)

The goal from the start has been to have playlist permission work the same way it does on content tool and leads to ensure a consistent experience for those coming into the tool once we release permissions.

From talking with Yudi, the disconnect may be related to how this isn't going through ObjectDB as the other tools do.  Should it be?

bq. Editor field is not required, it can be saved without any tags which could orphan a playlist (though it does seem to add ""resource"", which after refresh allows editing by ??)

Which resolution to this would you prefer?

1.  The editor field is required and cannot be saved empty
2.  The editor field is not required, and the ""default"" memberships that are applied give access to only system admins?

If (1), would you allow the editor field to be emptied in the future, or must it always have at least one (visible based on the rules of only showing brands/provider/etc. above) membership in it?

1) Upon initial tool load, the first playlist you create successfully saves, but the modal does not dismiss upon clicking the green button.  Instead, you have to click the close button to be taken back to the list.  Saving a new playlist should dismiss the modal and take you back to list view where you can edit your playlist.  Replicated this both as QA2 (limited user) and QA3 (enhanced user) in both the latest version of Chrome and Firefox.

2) Created ""QA3 Admin Feb 5"" playlist logged in as QA3 and tagged the editor with provider/Playlist Admin.  This playlist is currently editable by QA2.  It shouldn't be editable by QA2 since that account doesn't have the provider/Playlist Admin membership.

3) Created ""QA 2 Test Feb 5 #2"" logged in as QA2 and tagged only with the Wendy Wild tag.  Upon save, the WKTU-FM and NEWYORK-NY tags were added.

In the new content creation workflow, we show users ""Recently Used Presets"" - but from talking with Matt, it seems we're currently displaying recently EDITED presets.  We should show the X most recent presets that the individual user last used.
