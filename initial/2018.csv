should we do a quick script to explicitly set the premiere homepage value to 12?

Right now the tag name would get dropped directly onto the page, I could check if the display name is equal to the tag name, but surfacing that logic on the client isn't a great idea.  If we do it this way, would it be possible to surface a boolean that says whether or not the display name should be displayed?","17/Dec/18 11:34 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Not readily available due to an environment shortage. By design, all tag names should be user friendly, but there were some bad values imported from T2 that weren’t user friendly, and because the capacity to rename topics doesn’t exist, a display name override was determined to be the best solution. 

I don’t think we want to add logic to show or hide the display name, would prefer to fallback to the topic tag name if no display name override is provided, matching our other clients behavior.

Observed that a new error message is shown at the top of the page upon a user's first load of a new content item.  Some notes:

1) We shouldn't show an error to users every time they try to create a new item.  Can this be changed to only appear when a user hits the save button?

2) ""Required"" text on individual fields is not consistent.  On the headline, it's all lowercase, on primary image and blocks, it's Sentence Case.  Please make this uniform.  I prefer sentence case.

3) Item has errors at the top does not show an error pertaining to the primary image not being present.  We should specifically call that out.

4) If you insert a block but leave it blank, ""There was an unknown error"" appears.  Please update this to be more specific.

5)  If you have multiple blocks that are blank/have errors, we should explicitly call them out.  Can we reference the block type and corresponding error?  Ex, Gallery Block - Missing Title; or Embed Block - No Embed Provided; or Text Block - Empty.

6) Can we change ""This item is invalid"" to something more human?  ""This item has errors that must be corrected before saving."" or the like?","11/Dec/18 1:36 PM;1119767;1. No, because we prevent save until the content item is valid
2. Will do.
3. Primary image is not marked as required in the template. The error you're seeing is just saying that the url is required in order for the image to be valid.
4. I'll look into it.
5. Right now, block errors are not bubbling down correctly. I wasn't sure how much time to burn on that.
6. Error messages can always be changed ;)","11/Dec/18 1:48 PM;ccrnyc2msw;#1 understood, but I'm not cool with displaying an error before a user even does anything.  Is there another way we can show it independent of the save button but not upon initial load?  

#3 - this is required in the old tool.  Do we need to make it required here as well?","11/Dec/18 2:52 PM;1119767;1. We can hide it until the form is ""dirty"".

My understanding is the override tool allows you to set these links. 

For example if you make this search call for ""rock"":
http://us.api.iheart.com/api/v3/search/all?keywords=rock&startIndex=0&maxRows=10&newSearch=false&track=true&bundle=true&artist=true&station=true&keyword=true&playlist=false&podcast=false

In the response the bestMatch would be ""KEYWORDS"" which looks like this:
   ""keywords"": [
      {
        ""id"": 325,
        ""contentType"": ""link"",
        ""androidUrl"": ""ihr://goto/genre/12"",
        ""iphoneUrl"": ""ihr://goto/genre/12"",
        ""webUrl"": ""http://iheart.com/genre/rock-12/"",
        ""name"": ""Rock"",
        ""description"": ""Directory • Explore Rock on iHeartRadio"",
        ""imageUrl"": ""http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets/images/ca6d7e357b1578ce4c142335dc52db2a.jpg""
      }

Often these responses return a category like this web url: http://iheart.com/genre/rock-12/. This works fine for devices with screens but not for voice interactions like on Alexa which often error and would do better if the user is taken to a specific station.

We'd like add a ""homeceUrl"" as one of the returned parameters of the response of the keyword that could be set in the radioedit search override tool. Can we update the search override tool to accept a homeceUrl parameter?",,1115445,cccnyc1cma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hzzomv:,9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,Severity 4:  Low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*Example Use Case*

{quote}104.6 KISS FM is a top 40 station with Elvis Duran mornings, Jane Smith middays, Ryan Seacrest afternoons, and John Doe evenings.  The station is secretly planning to blow up the station tomorrow at 11AM; there should be no advance indication to listeners that a change is happening. Most staff members at the station will probably also be unaware that the station is being rebranded.  At 11AM on the day of the change, the station is turning into 104.6 The Bull (a country station).  Jane Smith and John Doe are laid off as they are top 40 DJs and we want them gone off the site ASAP since they are no longer in our employ.  Elvis Duran and Seacrest are still with the company, but aren't a part of the new station, so they should be gone as well.  Any reference to the KISS FM on-air schedule should be removed once 11AM hits.  The call letters of the station will remain the same after the change, so they'll continue to use the same site in Site Manager.{quote}

*Current Setup and Pain Points*

At the present, we get one dump a day from CORE that is processed during the overnight hours.  That means stations can either blank the schedule the day before (not preferred as the programmers feel it will show their hand), or deal with old station's on-air schedule continuing to be visible until the CORE import runs the next morning.

This schedule data is used to populate 1) the station homepage module, 2) the station schedule page, and 3) Flagship via WebAPI.

*Desired Functionality*

If a station changes formats at 11AM, we need the existing schedule to show until 11AM, at which time, we can go in and remove the schedule.  Realistically, if CORE can give us updates more than once a day, we'd want to show that, but in the interim, blowing out or hiding the existing data would be the way to go.

*Potential Approaches*

Do we add an option to suppress the schedule in Site Manager (where an admin would need to go turn it back on at a later date), or do we instead focus on blanking the schedule (that would remain blank until the import job next runs)?

1) There's currently no indication of who owns (and thus can edit) a preset.  Should we display the owner's name somewhere?

2) If a user is deactivated, the preset becomes orphaned.  Do we need to consider a system to purge presets that are owned by a user who's no longer with the company?  Or a way to transfer ownership of a preset?

The idea is that they'd create an app that would generate a catalog type and ID (eg. live + 1469 for Z100, or artist + 42064 for Audioslave) and pass that along with a collection tag to webapi.

Leads would have a collection populated with catalog attach items- all tagged with the same collection tag (eg. collections/marketing).

WebAPI would be passed that unique collection tag + catalog type + ID (eg. collections/marketing + artist + 42064) as inputs.

The collection lookup on WebAPI already obviously exists, but would need to accept the catalog type + ID values - (matching the catalog attach on the leads cards) and based on a match of all 3, return whatever data is needed via the Leads query of webapi.

Downstream, there's be a page that would render to users.  If there was a match via WebAPI, it'd use the data returned from that call... else, it would pass the same catalog type and ID number to AMP and get it from there.


Example card:
http://leads.radioedit.ihrint.com/#/edit/5bdc96cafef4767f0d17a9fd
This would be an override of the Classic Soul playlist.

for test purposes, i used collections/vadim-test

I'd want to pass into webapi:
collections/vadim-test + (id: 283087033::HtB4AbL8bbdiq5kYA1pT39) + (kind: curated)

Seeing all sorts of unexpected editor tags appear here:

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Since this playlist was created by a super user, it should have whatever tag allows super users to edit everything (Providers/Playlist Admin?) and any other tags that may have been applied by the user at time of creation/update.  I don't understand where all these other tags are coming from or what their significance is.","15/Jan/19 11:49 AM;1113313;For these two particular users, one is listed as a member_of another - http://auth.radioedit.ihrint.com/api/principals/user/ldap/svc-RadioEditQA3 - which is (one reason) why QA2 can edit QA3's playlist.

The AC in this particular ticket should be met, but I changed the order of operations when a playlist is saved so all those tags are visible in the editors field. We should look into removing this in favor of using actual taxonomy terms (e.g. brands, providers, etc) but as a quick workaround, would this logic work?

1) Playlist Admin users can read & edit anything
2) Everyone else can read everything, but only edit playlists they created
2a) I might be able to improve the editors field logic so that multiple people could be added without the other stuff, but I'm not sure how reliable that is without trying it out","15/Jan/19 3:48 PM;ccrnyc2msw;1 looks correct
2 seems different than the editor tagging that's in leads/content (and has been the focus of all the tickets related to this work).  I'd really like this to match the brand/provider tag setup that our users and support team are accustomed to.
2a sounds problematic given the discussions we had around content presets and dpd's having the user permission so they could delegate permission to their staff (eg, a dpd would be able to edit any/all playlists that has anything from the user namespace tagged on it)",16/Jan/19 10:34 AM;amamut;From what [~1113313] has told me the primary AC of this ticket has been addressed and deployed to stage.

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

so when people go to the category page with a category attached to the end (ie. /category/alternative-medicine-and-history) it will look up content tagged against that tag in taxonomy, which unblocks PN-2954.

I was able to save the path variable in SM so this looks good from my end.

Unfortunately, new Streams tool which is powered by ISO-sourced markets isn't conducive to this as there's no market called ""Digital"", so we have to make up a fake one... rinse and repeat for each new country we launch in.

How can we engineer this so users only have to tag an artist in one location, and use that tag to power both distribution to artist profiles and the topic tag shown on the content detail pages?

Re: example above, yes, that's a legit test case, except that the editor shouldn't have to tag the artist on 2 different screens.","30/Oct/18 8:35 AM;1119767;Then they should only tag artists in distribution, and we should legitimately remove artists from keywords.

Now we need a way for a user who has permission to artists to be able to tag only in the distribution box, but populate the keywords field in webapi with those tagged artists so that the link to the artist profile is shown at the bottom of the body.

It's surprising that any do work.,"07/Dec/18 1:05 PM;ccrnyc2msw;There are two ways that a user can get a video from Facebook:

*1) Copy video page URL.* Example: https://www.facebook.com/humanesocietydelta/videos/790653437932698/

Content Example: http://content.radioedit.ihrint.com/content/%2F5c0aaca9f6ab124537504b9b

In content tool, this seems to return a validation error:

 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

*2) Embed code (under the ••• menu).*  Example:

{code:java}
<iframe src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhumanesocietydelta%2Fvideos%2F790653437932698%2F&show_text=0&width=560"" width=""560"" height=""315"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowTransparency=""true"" allowFullScreen=""true""></iframe>
{code}

Content Example: http://content.radioedit.ihrint.com/content/%2F5c0aadadf6ab124537504ba6

This block displays a different validation error than the first one:

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

_... and a 3rd way that is reported to have worked intermittently:_

*3) Embed code from the ••• menu - with the domain swapped from www.facebook to m.facebook* (a hack that the editorial team discovered in the old content tool).  Example:

{code:java}
<iframe src=""https://m.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhumanesocietydelta%2Fvideos%2F790653437932698%2F&show_text=0&width=560"" width=""560"" height=""315"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowTransparency=""true"" allowFullScreen=""true""></iframe>
{code}

Content Example: http://content.radioedit.ihrint.com/content/%2F5c0ab24bf6ab124537504bbb

This shows the same validation error: 

 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail!

","11/Dec/18 1:06 PM;mbrown;It's clear from the screenshots that we need to do better with the error reporting on the syndication feature. It looks like the first example should show a warning (because the provider from ohembed is ""Facebook Video""), but doesn't. The other two warnings are correct: an arbitrary iframe paste into ohembed is not publishable to Apple News.  If their m.facebook hack actually works, I'd need to see an example article that illustrates it.","11/Dec/18 1:28 PM;ccrnyc2msw;Update... seems if a facebook video is part of a post... and you embed the post itself... it'll validate and show on Apple News no problem.

Take a look at https://content.radioedit.iheart.com/#/edit/5c0add847ed3541208004b10?from_list=network
Paul sent that as an example of the Facebook embed that works for Apple News … it’s a video that’s part of a POST and the POST is what’s being embedded. That is accepted.
So that’s the missing piece.

Mike Woodruff [1:10 PM]
excellent

Matt Berger [1:10 PM]
Embedding the video directly - doesn’t work. Embedding the video as part of a post, that’s their trick to get it to work.

The issue is indeed that Apple does not support a straight up video embed, but does support when included in a post.  We've significantly improved the Apple News validation messaging to call out that this is not supported and steer users to include the video in a post- and then use that post in the article as an embed block.

In the course of this ticket, we also significantly humanized all the Apple News-related validation messages.

[9:36 AM] David Levine: ~350
[9:36 AM] David Levine: thats what missing for me
[9:37 AM] David Levine: stations, not markets of course
[9:37 AM] Laurent Vauthrin: Well, I was going down a rabbit hole guessing over here but yes, the pattern is that primary market is missing for the ones that return no markets... which matt said like an hour ago
[9:41 AM] David Levine: @SamOrpol
[9:42 AM] Greg Cerchione: @alex will these all have to be done manually? If so, I can pitch in and get some done if its just re-set the market save and approve
[9:43 AM] Alex Mamut: stream id 161 is missing fields on it like call sign and station logo. The api filtered that one out because AMP doesn't like when those fields are blank
[9:43 AM] Alex Mamut: same with 165
[9:43 AM] Greg Cerchione: it's an inactive station

Ideally, we'd like to be able to manually curate the genres that we choose for international. For example, if Mexico wants 80's and 90's hits to show up in their genre picker, we should be able to do that. The current state is that since it exists in directory for US/MX, we'd have to add it to the genre picker in both countries. 

Something on the UI would be like this: 

US - Show in FUX, Show in Directory
MX - Show in FUX, Show in Directory
CA - Show in FUX, Show in Directory

[~1119767] get with me to discuss.

We will use the national news feed (news.iheart.com) to create articles to FB IA. We can do this by understanding what ""where's"" are considered national.

The news.iheart.com page should have more than enough ""viewership"" to start a test.

No, I need to use a user token to post Facebook Instant articles. It is one of my biggest complaints with the system so far. In a later phase, when we expose this in RadioEdit, we'll use an OAuth2 flow to allow any site admin to log in with their Facebook login as long as they have access to the station's Facebook page.

Found that for some reason, a few sites may have a second /pay source redirect, but this seems to be the exception rather than the rule.  Because stations can delete extra redirects - and fire uses the first one it comes across - and the old billpay site redirects to the new one, we're not going to solve for this.

{quote}Web is moving news.iheart.com/news/ over to www.iheart.com/news/ , using the webapi site -> timeline function to populate the data. Currently there is no way to get the Topic link/name out of graphql, please add this data (really anywhere is fine, summary, subscription or payload seem like reasonable places to me). For reference an image of one of the article tiles is attached, we're trying to populate the <a/> tag that's below the image and above the title.{quote}

We already include the collection/topic tag in the timeline service, just need to add the display name:

Stage query:

{code:java}
query NewsDirectory($site: SiteQuery!, $topic:String, $page: Int) {
        site(select: $site) {
          timeline(topic: $topic, page:$page) {
            pub_start
            payload {
              external_url
              is_sponsored
              feed_vendor
              canonical_url
            }
      	subscription{
          tags
						}
            summary {
              image
              title
              description
              author
            }
            slug
          }
        }
      }
{code}

Selected output:

{code:java}
""subscription"": [
            {
              ""tags"": [
                ""collections/iheartradio-music-news"",
                ""collections/trending-pop"",
                ""brands/DEFAULT- (2135)""
              ]
            },
{code}

For the two collections shown, the goal would be to provide the friendly names of ""iHeartRadio Music News"" and ""Trending"", respectively.  We'd want to retain the tag itself so that they can continue to generate the link to the topic page.

September 24th in RadioEdit Support:

Andrew Vickory:  Hey, sorry to keep bugging y'all, I'm trying to figure out where the data for https://news.iheart.com/news/ comes from.  I was using graphql, but just realized the topic links don't appear to exist in those schema (using the site -> timeline functions with the slug ""ihm-ip"").  Is that the wrong endpoint, or am I just not seeing something?  2:40 PM

Mark Cahill: @AndrewVickory what do you mean by ""topic links don't appear to exist in those schema""? 2:53 PM

Andrew Vickory:  sorry, if you look at the page, there are these ""Music News"" and ""Rock News"" links with each news item  2:54 PM

Mark Cahill: the eyebrows? 2:54 PM

Andrew Vickory:  yeah, the per news item ones  2:54 PM

Keith Hayden:  so I think he's looking for topic name to be part of the data for the articles payload, and like we do on fire, we generate link as /topic/slugified-topic-name 2:56 PM

Keith Hayden:  I don't think web ever needed topic before, so it's not in the schema, but now they need it 2:58 PM

Mark Cahill: it *is* in the subscription. the raw tag at least:  2:59 PM

Mark Cahill:

Andrew Vickory:  alrighty I'll ticket and just implement around the tags for now 3:05 PM

Mark Cahill: @AndrewVickory yeah, so if you want to display eyebrows on iheart.com, you likely want to have us handle it in webapi. otherwise, you would have to hit taxonomy from web, which seems like a bad idea. 3:06 PM

Saw the new ""Allowed Users"" field that allows you to specify editors (in the context of content tool) using brand tags of who should be able to use each template.

I'm not sure this works as is since here is no single brand tag that all editors have access to (nor do I know if that would be appropriate to do).

My first hunch is to give an option that allows template editors to specify whether a template is available to all users - or to just those from the tagged brands.  Adam had an alternate idea to allow access to everyone unless restricted to a smaller group (which I appreciate the code simplification, but worry about someone creating a test template and forgetting to restrict access).

The above setup does introduce a small security loophole - but that can be mitigated by sysadmins not delegating permission to users (other than users/authenticated for templates that everyone should see).

* You have a few places with things like ""provide benefits such as providing"" which could use some streamlining.
* I'm not entirely sure what your third diagram is showing me
* There are a few places you make reference to things which you expect your audience to know, such as ""Facade pattern"" which you provide a link to, but it might help to include a summary of what it is
* Similarly concepts like ""resolvers"" ""schemas"" ""data loaders"". You and I work with those day to day, but some interested parties may not know them by those names
* You have a section called ""Documenting your apis"" where you make reference to api docs, but then only talk about the playground. the graphiql app thing had a kind of interactive documentation of the params that the endpoint was looking for for different queries. I don't know if the apollo playground has something like that, but might be worth a mention.
* Your conclusion (always the hardest part) seems... I dunno, kinda clunky. Reads like a TLDR. I dunno, I just feel like I could not read it and come away with the same info.
* Another consideration is try to minimize blind links. You have things like ""report errors"" as link text, and I can assume it's going to documentation of that feature or something, but no real description.
In that particular case, maybe saying ""GraphQL solves this problem much more elegantly by allowing resolvers to report errors to the client without terminating the entire request, [link] as documented here[/link]
* Also take a chisel to a few ""wall-o'-text"" spots you got in there. (Conclusion for example).

Users can put whatever they want in there; we have no association between content created by the same author or the ability to show any metadata about a given author.

How can we maintain support for the existing freeform/throwaway author value (for legacy content), while allowing frequent contributors to tag using a re-usable value?

Some considerations:

* Author name does not usually equal AD user name
* One AD user may pen under multiple author names
* Multiple AD users may pen under a single author name
* We'll need permissioning so that users don't create content under the name of someone else without their consent
* We still need to support one-off values that aren't likely to be re-used such as a sponsor that provides a single piece of branded content - or ingested content (from billboard or the like) where it can be a slew of different authors that don't repeat often)
* It'd be a beast to manually create 2,500 author profiles - and a mess if we ask 2,500 authors who frequently typo to do it themselves

We'd want the ability to supply metadata for an author... things like email, twitter, facebook, phone, short bio, picture, etc.

What is the best way to organize this data and tool it?  What updates need to be made to the APIs and clients to support across all platforms (including Apple News, AMP, etc)

Once in place, what data service would be required to either show related content - or generate a page about that author, showcasing what they wrote?",,ccrnyc2msw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AR-4232,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hz76cv:,9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,Severity 4:  Low,,RadioEdit_20_Tycho,RadioEdit_21_Ultron,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

changing a microsite's brand tag is going to cause its timeline items under a site to link direct to the site and not have the microsite as the eyebrow. If that's undesireable, we'll need an AL ticket to smooth that over.  (I'm going to be storing the previous brand tags used, in the event of a change, just like with slugs.

I don't think this is a huge deal.  Content times off the homepage so quickly that it's not even worth updating.  Worst case scenario they see the content on an unbranded content detail page.","05/Oct/18 11:45 AM;ccrbdl1mje;At the current time there's no need to change a microsite brand tag, just a site","09/Oct/18 8:39 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Tested on dev.

* Confirmed that slugs/tags already in use error out
* Confirmed that with a new unique slug/tag, it saves
* Observed past slug and brand tag were retained as additional values
* Confirmed new brand tag is created
* Old brand tags can be deleted from site

+Unsure how to verify the following: ([~mbrown], please advise)+
* ""clean up archived_brands if the new value also exists in the archive ""
* ""add the new value to -segments and- lookup structure""
* ""add the old value to segments"" (on the test example, the former brand tag does not appear in additional segments

[9:27 AM] Matt Brown: The archived_brands cleanup...I tested that by changing the brand to a different name, and then back to what it was. The original name is then removed from the old-brands list on the general page for the site
[9:28 AM] Matt Brown: For your third bullet, you're probably running up against the bug where the index data isn't refreshed on save. If you refresh after the brand change, you'll see the old one in additional segments","09/Oct/18 2:05 PM;ccrnyc2msw;Tested config calls:

Custom cache service:

Level 1 features:
	- HTTP interface (or HTTP/2)
		- What does this look like? How are complex commands done if at all?
		- HTTP is great for portability and client support, we just need a sane way of using it.
	- Group key invalidation, aka surrogate keys, aka cache tagging.
		- Done through abstraction with redis plus lua trash collection?
	- Easy distributed locks
	- Easy dogpile prevention (always on)

Level 2 features:
	- Callthrough caching (aka CDN mode)
		a proxy http request that is cached transparently. This is like a CDN, but local...
		- advantages:
			- doesn't have to go out to the world
			- doesn't depend on external services
			- can provide a keep-warm routine if it continues to be requested
				e.g. x-refresh-after header causes api endpoint to be re-fetched. Only happens once unless another request that has x-refresh-after set comes in.
		- disadvantages:
			- takes our resources

		Research and implement something like APQ from Apollo for this perhaps.

If Adswizz's servers are down (eg. 504/request timeout), it blocks users from approving changes made to streams.

We need to explore ways to make the Streams tool not dependent on 3rd parties such as Adswizz.  If upon approving a change, Adswizz is not available, the rest of the changes should go through, but users should be alerted that Adswizz is down and be given the option to re-try.

Would the solution we built for Apple News in the Content Tool work here as well?  There, upon publishing a piece of content that is intended for Apple News, the content is immediately published - and a request is triggered to Apple News. Users are shown that the Apple push is pending.  Upon successful transmission to Apple, we update the indicator in the publish panel as such.

This would delay the Adswizz updates but not keep the user locked out of accepting stream changes. The user would not need to do anything extra and the change would get pushed eventually (as long as Adswizz API can process the request).

From discussing with Matt on HipChat:

[2:57 PM] Matt Brown: As long as it exists in the database, we're going to pick it up
[2:58 PM] Matt Brown: It's possible we're no longer using the right database. There are multiple choices:

[2:58 PM] Matt Brown: (the last one in the list is what we've used before, and I didn't change it)
[3:00 PM] Matt Brown: And actually the db name we're using in prod doesn't exist in FAC stage. So it may just be a matter of finding out which db to use. I don't even know who to ask

","04/Sep/18 4:40 PM;ccrnyc2msw;Meeting set for 9/10 at 3PM to review with [~lvauthrin], [~1098562], [~1104800], [~mbrown], [~tlong], and [~mfielder].","10/Sep/18 3:21 PM;tlong;Discussed with [~1098562] [~mfielder] [~mbrown] [~lvauthrin] and [~1104800]

Right Solution:
The FAC catalog we're using is no longer updated. Not to mention AMP would prefer it if we didn't look into the database directly as it's a complex set of data that they manage fairly carefully. The preference would be to use an existing catalog export system and add an artist export to that. Which would dump an easily parsable file to S3 that we could pick up periodically.

We were also asked to give an overview as to where and how the artist namespace in the taxonomy is used.

Fast Solution:
If this is a serious issue the AMP team can copy the current view of the data to the mongo database we've been using as a stop-gap measure.",18/Sep/18 10:30 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Trey is going to ping the group from last week to make sure the AMP work is moving forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* Boundary frame of preview looks fine
* ""Rendered By Fire"" won't make sense to our users.  Can you please change that to ""Content Preview""?
* Not seeing any padding at the bottom of the publish pane.  On shorter browser heights, the ""Publish"" button is smushed up against the bottom of the window.  See attached.
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 
* Confirmed that double preview is gone
* Confirmed that publish origin does not disappear

There's also still an issue of asset blocks not being scaled to the preview width here - even though that is being done in FiRE.  Are we missing a container?  Unsure if that's in the spirit of this ticket or not.  ","23/Aug/18 1:47 PM;1119767;Yes, I can change that text. The padding was supposed to be between the buttons and the rest of the settings. Perhaps we need to somehow affix the buttons to the bottom of the off-canvas?

I would ticket the scaling issue separately. Your theory seems valid, but that would need to be handled in the html output adapter.",23/Aug/18 2:49 PM;ccrnyc2msw;Update looks good on dev.  Created AR-4588 to address preview responsiveness.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Added a billboard image to a block and confirmed that 3rd party assets are scaled and constrained to the canvas and the display looks fine

Added a second asset block with an uploaded image.  Observed that the visual treatment is different, it doesn't fill up the canvas.

Further, once the image is selected, the ""choose item"" link is still there... which seems to conflict the 3rd bullet point in this ticket.  I do think we should have the option to swap an image, perhaps the text after an asset has been selected should be ""Change Item"" instead of ""Choose Item""?

This way when a market needs to be renamed it will update the display name and the market name will stay the same.

* Add display_name to market tags and populate them (script).
* Migrate stream, market, genre, provider data to include memberName and display_name
* Create custom tag-pill and tag-renderer component to include display_name and memberName.
* Update genre, market, and provider edit components to save display_name to taxonomy as well as SMT.
* Update edit stream component to display the display_name field while also saving the memberName to streams.
* Update AMP export APIs to use display_name and memberName accordingly.

Did some further testing with MX selected as the country and found that live stations associated with a provider that is not available in MX (eg. Clear Channel) do not show up in search results for both Leads and Content.

However, it doesn't look like we ever built out country support for lookups in the Search Overrides tool.  That appears to be pulling the US catalog regardless of which country is selected (and there is no option to select a country in the search modal).  I suspect this is no better or worse than what is currently in place for CA that it shouldn't block launching MX.  As such, if you wanted to setup a search override for a catalog item that doesn't exist in US, you'd need to manually supply link/title/etc.

Created AR-4614 to upgrade to the current catalog lookup, but given that I haven't heard any complaints from CA on this, not sure how urgent it is.  

Attempted to also test podcast, artists, and tracks - but as Mexico hasn't yet been setup as a country in Custom Talk Prod, can't test podcasts.  And from talking with Chris Graham, artists and tracks are not planned for MX, so unable to test those.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spike: Solve for www.iheartradio.com redirect requirements,AR-4450,648184,,Story,Completed,AR,Agile Radioedit,software,howella,,,Px - Unprioritized,Completed,,ccrnyc2msw,ccrnyc2msw,01/Aug/18 11:57 AM,20/Sep/18 2:37 PM,03/May/19 9:49 AM,22/Aug/18 3:48 PM,,,,,,,,0,,,,"On July 31st, we updated the fastly config for news.iheart.com to redirect the root to news.iheart.com/news via 301 redirect - and for all standard content detail pages to 301 redirect instead of the existing 302.

Unfortunately this had the unintended side effect of causing www.iheartradio.com to also redirect to news.iheart.com/news, since that is a secondary domain on IHM-IP... and the way FiRE is built, a secondary domain will always redirect to the primary domain before doing anything else.  This caused users going to www.iheartradio.com from marketing materials to reach the news page instead of the www homepage.  As such, the fastly update was rolled back.

Need to solve for the following use cases:

*+news.iheart.com+*
# root / should 301 redirect to https://news.iheart.com/news
# standard content detail pages should 301 redirect to the www.iheart.com version of the page
# all other pages should behave like normal fire sites (either loading the page or hitting search override)

*+www.iheartradio.com and iheartradio.com:+*
# root / should 301 redirect to https://www.iheart.com
# standard content detail pages should 301 redirect to the www.iheart.com version of the page
# all other pages should behave like normal fire sites and serve on IHM-IP/news.iheart.com... 

Worth nothing that for subpages on www.iheartradio.com, since this domain hasn't been primary in years, all links of value likely hit the redirect tool already - which can be done both on the FiRE side and on the www side. 

For transparency, the aforementioned fastly update hit on all of the above points except #1 for www.iheartradio.com/iheartradio.com",,ccrnyc1rar,ccrnyc2msw,tterry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SREONCALL-295,SRESWEEP-219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"# Engineering review between RadioEdit and Flagship team to determine best approach

Yesterday we made a fastly change to change the root redirect of news.iheart.com to point to news.iheart.com/news instead of www.iheart.com; a high priority item from the SEO audit.

The domain www.iheartradio.com is a secondary domain on IHM-IP (primary domain news.iheart.com); and the way FiRE is built, secondary domains always redirect to the primary domain before doing anything else... so what was happening is that www.iheartradio.com was 301'ing to news.iheart.com, which was 301'ing to news.iheart.com/news.

I will be launching an investigation into all known use cases of www.iheartradio.com to help determine the best path forward.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reviewed WebAPI but was unable to locate this data point; spoke with Matt on HipChat that we need to be able to track that separately in Jira, so created AR-4500 to address.

While testing, found that the corresponding switch seems to have locally set ""null"" values that don't allow it to inherit the master site values.  Created AR-4501 to wipe those values so that individaul sites can inherit from master.

One note, the facebook pixel switch and corresponding ID value are both NOT locked down to sys admins.  I've added to AR-4231 where we already had the checkbox on the list to lock down.

# /photos/ should be modified to exclude any that also have /topic/ in the URL.  So /photos/main/ should remain on the list.... but /topic/photos/ would be excluded from the purge.

Once we have the final list, purge as follows at 2PM on August 2nd:

He's going to review this. ,"19/Oct/18 2:18 PM;cccnyc1njt;I've been going back and forth with George and things are looking pretty good in staging. Here the outstanding items that still need to be addressed with most recent build in staging:
1. Once a show is accepted, episode ingestion still needs to be triggered. 
2. Validation checkboxes on the Preview screen don't appear to be working. 
3. Not getting a duplicate notification/error when I enter an existing RSS URL. 
4. While not a requirement, also, would it be possible to make the artwork thumbnails smaller in the Preview screen. Right now they are fairly large, so by going a little smaller, it will streamline the over lists of shows that appear on that screen. But this is just a personal perference. 

Aside from that, I've confirmed the job is successfully uploading show info to Postgres, messaging the show to AMP, and generating a show profile page within the Custom Talk Tool, where we can edit update shows individually.

On Chrome, I'm getting a 504 error. This occurs every time; even if I only push through a single show. And I've confirmed that episode ingestion is not getting scheduled for these shows. 

Just out of curiousity, in the processing that occurs, are we waiting to the ingestion api to completely resolve and initial episode ingestion to complete/","31/Oct/18 9:42 AM;gvilches;This is just because the staging ingestion URL we have is no longer valid, so we're hitting timeouts there.  Does ingestion still have a staging service?

Currently: http://10.5.40.129:8080/

Otherwise, ingestion URL works in production.  This may not be something we can test in staging, but let's ask the appropriate people first as to if/where that service might be.","31/Oct/18 11:07 AM;cccnyc1njt;That makes sense.

Did some quick testing and episodes still aren't coming through. 

Here is an example: https://customtalk.radioedit.ihrint.com/shows/27577861/

I'm also checking our cron tables and not seeing jobs get scheduled. 

When triggering ingestion in staging, this is the api use - stg-ingtalk101.ihrcloud.net:8080/ingester/api/ingestion/run/27577861

Is this the url that you are hitting when triggering ingestion? It not only runs the initial ingestion but also schedules the cron job for all future scans. ","31/Oct/18 2:24 PM;cccnyc1njt;If it would be helpful, this is the sql I use to check the cron status of an individual show:

Since the ask surrounds the fact that Google errors on a blank sitemap, maybe a much more reasonable approach is to just make sure the sitemap is never blank.

To make sure the sitemap is never blank, we'll add topic pages. When we have the closed topic list we can add them all, but for now we'll just hardcode one popular topic into the list.

From page 60:

{quote}Recommended HTML Sitemap Format

Technical standards for developing an HTML sitemap are:

* The sitemap can be organized by date or topic; whichever is most appropriate.
* The sitemap should utilize only basic template formatting without any ads or other extraneous content.
* Only canonical URLs should be included in the sitemap; any duplicate content URLs should be excluded.
* The sitemap URLs should be static and every page must contain a link back to the main page of the sitemap.
* Utilize a flat file structure with every landing page URL no more than 3-4 levels deep in the sitemap.
* No single sitemap page should have more than 200 links or be larger than 100K (the
sitemap can be paginated to allow for categories that contain many links).
* When paginating the sitemap, provide links to 10-20 pages on every page (i.e. [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 …. Next] instead of just next/previous links).
* Only links to crawler accessible content should be included. URLs that are blocked by robots.txt, pages with a “noindex” META tag and redirected URLs should all be omitted.
* The HTML sitemap should be updated daily or as new content creation dictates.
* Content should be linked in descending order to expose the most recent content first.
* For multi-page content such as slideshows, include the URL for each slide (except in cases in which having the individual slides be indexed and ranked independently is not desired).
* For multi-page articles, only the URL for page one should be included
* Have a link to the HTML sitemap on all pages of a site (typically in a footer)
* Give each page in the sitemap a unique HTML title tag. The format will vary based on the way the sitemap is organized, but differentiate by section or date, as well as page number.
* Each sitemap page should have a self-referencing rel=canonical tag (i.e. the rel=canonical tag should point to the canonical URL for that specific page)

Examples of HTML sitemaps that follow best practices include:

Confirmed that RDS Pi code is populated, primary genre is default, and that feed has a URL.

Changed the description to add an exclamation point at the end and saved.  Confirmed that save was successful and I was taken back to the stream list.

Confirmed that the description change shows up and that the RDS Pi code no longer shows as changed.

However, genre is still showing a change from Country to Default... when this value was not changed in the tool.  Is there a reason the changes screen shows that the genre has been updated?

Also seeing that the changes screen indicates that the Feed value was previously stored as null, but shows a change to www.iheart.com/live/109/ - even though this value was not changed in my edit.

Is there a reason the changes screen is showing values that weren't actually changed?

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! ","20/Jul/18 10:40 AM;amamut;I think we were talking earlier about a migration that went bad and put the streams into a bad states. The Primary Genre is set to default but default is missing from the genres array. The app is fixing the issue.

When typecasting the field to int I did not check to see if the field was a tag causing the typecast to return 0 which is the id for genres/Default. This is why all of the streams were updated to genres/Default. I have made an update to the script which should not cause this again.","31/Jul/18 9:32 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Tested on stage at http://stream-manager.radioedit.ihrint.com/#/stream/edit/1981, updating name and description.

I am still seeing the Primary Genre as default upon load.  

Saved station and am still seeing the genre as changed in the changes screen.  Feed is also changing values despite how no changes were made in the tool.

As of right now, I can't verify this ticket.

Upon initial load, observed the primary genre is still shown as default, even though in the API it's classic rock:

 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! 
 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 

Changed description and saved.

Went to changes screen and observed that the feed is no longer showing as a changed value... but that the genre which was previously Classic Rock (even though it wasn't shown in the tool) is now default.

 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

I still don't think this is working.

If the existing genre is Classic Rock, that's what should be shown on the Stream screen.  Updating another data point on the stream should not cause the genre to change to default.  

Note, feed and Pi were not an issue on this test.  ","07/Aug/18 1:34 PM;amamut;I went through the streams and fixed the data. Can you try again?
","08/Aug/18 12:11 PM;ccrnyc2msw;Re-tested the above on http://stream-manager.radioedit.ihrint.com/#/stream/edit/1453

Confirmed that upon initial load an RDS Pi code was present, feed was here, and default genre is country.

Changed the description of the station and saved.

Examined changes screen.  Noted that there is a genre change still showing -but visually it's the same old and new genre.  Reviewed with Alex, he explained that this is existing prod functionality due to a market change on the provider... The visual impact in the tool is less than is currently in prod.

Confirmed that I can now apply a market and brand to a stream even if I don't have permissions to those in Taxonomy - based on the global-admin permission.

Removed the global-admin permission and confirmed that I can't access any streams - and can only create streams for brands and markets that I have permission to via user manager.  However, noticed, that even with permission to a market, I can't see streams associated with that market (eg. gave NEWYORK-NY market permission, but don't see any of the streams that are associated with that market in my list.  Not sure that this is a common use case as stream management isn't really done at the market level.

Added country-admin to the same user and confirmed that without a country permission, there are no functional options within the tool.  Add countries/US and confirmed that all US streams are visible - as well as changes/markets/etc.  Also confirmed that within streams I can add any US-based market or brand (but not any canada brands or markets).

Found an issue where provider admins cannot currently apply markets to their stations, which blocks them from saving.  Discussed with Greg whether the preference was to allow selection of any market - or to individual permission markets to each provider's admin and decided on the former.  Created AR-4316 to address, but that's not a blocker for launch as domestic provider admins aren't getting access to this tool immediately.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal is to base permissions on what we currently have in Content and Leads where one or more editor tag is applied to a playlist.

Playlists editors could be brands or providers just like leads... we'd also look to add a namespace for record labels (eg. so that we could allow Universal or Warner Records to create a playlist in the tool.  Down the road, we'd also think through using artists as an editor namespace (eg, if we wanted to give the ability for individual artists to create and manage their own playlists).  

Unsure that we need to a country admin as providers are country specific.

Need to think through the relationship between brands and providers.  For example, how could the playlist guy at Bell Canada change any playlists of brands from that provider without us having to dole out individual brand permissions.  

Would still need global admins (eg. Kavi) who could adjust anything.

Upon initial rollout, we'd need to batch apply permissions to existing playlists.

Sample User Levels:

# Global Playlist User/Admin - ability to create and adjust all playlists app-wide - both dynamic and manual playlists
# Provider Playlist User - ability to create and adjust all playlists where that provider is an editor - or by any of the brands associated with that provider.  Ability to specify whether these users should be able to manage dynamic playlists and/or manual playlists.
# Record Label Playlist User - ability to create and adjust all playlists where that label is an editor (or, down the road, any artists that are associated with that label). This use case would be manual playlists only
# Market Playlist User- Ability to create and adjust all playlists where that market is an editor, including owned by sites/microsites associated with that market.  Ability to specify whether these users should be able to manage dynamic playlists and/or manual playlists.  (initially, it would be manual playlists only)
# Brand Playlist User - Ability to create and adjust all playlists where that brand is an editor, including those owned by microsites associated with the site brand.   Ability to specify whether these users should be able to manage dynamic playlists and/or manual playlists.  (initially, it would be manual playlists only)

Note, out of scope for this ticket, but to be solved in Q4 is the locale-specific distribution and customization of playlists... eg, which are available in Canada, what needs to be translated, solving tracks that aren't available in a given region.","11/Jul/18 1:43 PM;ccrnyc2msw;Discussed on the phone with George today.

There's two separate components... how we tag playlists - and how we know what to show users.  

Tickets: 

# One for adding editor tagging at the playlist level (first ticket)
# Playlist visibility (both in list and detail view) to only show playlists that a user has access to.  Need to figure out how to show playlists by taxonomy.  Mirror after the current leads setup. (second ticket)
# Taxonomy for Record Labels. Is this in a new taxo bucket, or do we tack on to vendors or providers? (may not be required for MVP)

First two should not be in the same sprint.  3rd may come later.

Questions: 

# If we have an outside user (eg. record rep or Cumulus employee), is there any additional permissioning we need to have to keep them out of other areas - Is support allocating the correct permissions in user manager enough?

[4:08 PM] Matt Brown: It doesn't
[4:08 PM] Mike Woodruff: do i need to give her some level of access in SMT?
[4:08 PM] Matt Brown: This is being caused by countries being set up as controlling tags of other things, creating a huge chain of access
[4:10 PM] Matt Brown: (streams, brands, markets, providers, ...etc?)
[4:17 PM] Matt Brown: I did just think of one workaround @mike: If she filters the main list page by ""web-homescreen"" and ""US"" (using the namespace filter), clicks on a card in the list, and then hits ""save + new"", then it starts a new card with those two tags already selected
[4:17 PM] Mike Woodruff: i tried giving her access to a bunch of the top level stuff to see what happens
[4:18 PM] Mike Woodruff: if that doesn't work, i can try the save + new option
[4:18 PM] Mike Woodruff: but i think we need to address whatever is happening here next sprint
[4:18 PM] Matt Brown: agreed{quote}","27/Jun/18 4:50 PM;tlong;Short Term Solution:
SMT will have to proxy or manage taxo lookups on the server based on the user's security. Right now, linking country to markets will break leads and invalidate much of the security held there.

Long Term Solution:
1. Extend taxo relationship data to have a name. Names can be either ""bucket:<bucket_name>"" or ""user:<whatever_string>"".
2. ObjectDB should stop using general purpose relationships (unnamed relations) for security. Instead it should limit tag relationship lookup to include the name ""bucket:<bucket_being_accessed>"" or ""bucket:<prefix_of_dotted_bucket_name>"".
3. Taxo application should represent multiple relationships and allow editing of those.

This will give us the ability to maintain separate permission hierarchies per bucket. We cannot do this per application because there is no secure method for determining which application a query is for. With separate permission hierarchies per bucket and with objectdb selecting the current buckets permissions we can more tightly control where the meaningful relationships are.",09/Jul/18 10:48 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Are there followup tickets from this spike that we can link?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implement application based atomically incrementing numbering for builds.

Enable per build number aliases e.g. master or beta.

RadioCTL to print all valid urls to the new build.

proxyd to enable on demand application starting with cool interstitial.

proxyd can track LRU application list and issue shutdowns if the application record allows it.

Inject application id, build number and build date into application environment.

Create regui component to track if a new build has occurred and display a notice. Automatically refresh the browser if it's been more than 24 hours.

I think what we need is a list of rules for these calendar events. Content items have a set of editors on them which is carried over to the event.

it looks like WBZY-FM is the editor group, so i would expect anyone with permission to that brand could edit/delete the event.  

Might be worth allowing additional editors to be added from within the calendar tool- that way if a content item is brought in that the calendar editor doesn't have permission for, they can add a permission to the actual event so they could edit later.  Block saving if current user doesn't have permission to any of the currently tagged editors (with appropriate error message shown to users?)

Should we also check permissions within the tool to ensure that non-premissioned users can't make changes?  If multiple occurrences were saved by a user that didn't have permission to make a change, that's a little troubling.  ","24/May/18 2:13 PM;amamut;# I understand that anyone with WBZY-FM should be able to edit/delete the event, and that's how it works now.
# Adding editors is a good idea but doesn't solve the main issue. You are able to attach ANY piece of content to an event no matter who is able to edit it because of the nature of content tool. People without permissions to edit the content can still view it. When the content is attached to the event, calendar tool is carrying over the edit permissions from the piece of content to the event. But its setting these as both read and write. So a user can create an event, attach a piece of content they don't have permission to edit, save the event and then its lost to them forever because they can no longer access it.
# No one without permissions to edit an event can even see the event so that's fine.","29/May/18 10:18 AM;amamut;Went over this with Mike, after trying to attach content which has editor tags that user doesn't have access to tool displays save error. So user should not be able to lose visibility of event after saving with bad tags.

Looking further into production issue where occurrences lost members, I could not find a way that this would occur unless there was an objectdb issue.

I'm not sure I can update any code which would help with this issue.","30/May/18 8:55 AM;ccrnyc2msw;As there's no user reports of this happening attached to the ticket and there's no clear engineering approach to take, I'm going to close this out as unsolvable.

Confirmed that I can successfully delete locally created pages and revert changes to national pages on both the site and microsite level.  Both local and national admins can do this based on permissions - while originally envisioned as national admins only, since we've elimitaed the ability for local users to delete national pages, I don't think we need that anymore.  

*Request:*

I'd like to update some of the messaging so it's a little more user-friendly:

+Section Labels+

On the pages screen, can we adjust the section labels as follows?

Pages on this site = Local Pages
Inherited from master = National Pages

+Revert confirmation modal description:+

""Are you sure you'd like to restore this page to the default settings?  Any customizations will need to be re-applied.""

+Delete confirmation modal description:+

""Are you sure you'd like to delete this page?  Once deleted, this page can NOT be restored.""

+Blank section title:+

Current: ""No sites match your search or you have no permissions. Modify your search query to try again.""

Confirmed that search overrides can now be edited and successfully save.  Mark was nice enough to change the copy on one of the buttons to be more logical.

Note that the responsive layout of this page is still busted, but I think that's being solved elsewhere in the SM refactor.

Versioned binaries are stored based on a hash of the contents of the file. If we change working copies to also be based a hash of the file, then we can combine the three environments into a single S3 bucket and not have to store 3 copies of 1.3T of data. This will also make copying data between environments easier because we can copy the DB references from prod to stage/dev without having to copy the S3 resources.

In order to prevent orphaned binaries from accumulating, this feature would also require a database collection to track reference counts for binaries. Any time a binary is saved to S3, we would increment the reference count. When a new binary is uploaded to an existing resource, we would decrement the old reference count. A periodic task can look for 0-count binaries and remove them from S3.

1. Create a new service to manage S3 binaries and reference counts.
2. Update objectdb to use the new service to manager reference counts when binary data is attached to a resource.
3. Copy all binaries to a new bucket using the new content-hash bashed filename.
4.

Need to ingest station-level KML polygon files as provided by IHM Radio Engineering (sample attached).  All KML files are available for download from the following S3 bucket (includes all radio stations, including IHM and non-O&O stations):

bucket name: ihr-kml

Each KML filename follows the naming convention:   <STATION-FCCID>.kml

Once ingested into SMT, KML files need to be accessible by AMP.

[EDIT]

This ticket is to track future work for editing KML for a station. When KML modification is desired SMT will ingest the KML file for a station and then expose fields for modification. Once saved it will generate new KML for a station and save it on streams/metadata and be exposed as an api call for that station: https://stream-manager.radioedit.ihrint.com/api/v1/kml/1234",,amamut,ccrnyc1mcr,kchoe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AGILEAMP-3323,,,,,,,,,,,AR-3949,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,04/Apr/18 3:43 PM;kchoe;10016.kml;https://jira.ihrint.com/secure/attachment/155506/10016.kml,,,,,,,,,,,"# KML files ingested into SMT

{quote}Google News Sitemaps
Much more so than general XML Sitemaps for Web Search, Google News XML Sitemaps are critical for competing in Google News. Creating and maintaining a Google News sitemap is one of the most important factors in Google News success. The Google News Sitemap is based on the XML sitemap, but has additional news-specific tags.
iHeart struggles to compete for Google News traffic. Part of the reason for this is that its news content is hard to discover. Google News crawling and indexation is known to be much more frustrating than its Google Search cousin, making it critical to lead it to the right content.

Protocol documentation:
https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html

we want all of the hrefs for two different things:
# all content whose origin is the site
# all content whose origin is the microsite for every microsite whose primary-site is the site

The API will likely be an rpc call that lives in site manager. It has the data needed to find the content, and it has the brains to generate canonical urls. This differs from the timeline query in that it *only* cares about content whose origin is the site. We aren't doing the general-purpose timeline query. 

Since there is a limit of 50K urls per sitemap, we will use what's called a sitemap index to list each sitemap, and then create a sitemap for each day for which a site has published content.

There is debate on whether or not we should calculate the sitemap live and cache it, or calculate it offline and store it somewhere. Do some performance testing on the query to see what response times look like before building the entire solution. This needs to be exposed via fire, which does not do any rpc calls today.

Looks good to me.  ,21/May/18 8:46 AM;1119767;I suspect that the proposed solution doesn't meet the goal. It seems like you would want web to pass in the site the content item is being displayed on in order to test if it matches the publish origin. I would think that original content only published on a non-flagship site _would_ have amp enabled?,"21/May/18 9:26 AM;ccrnyc2msw;The goal is to only have the amphtml link present when content is viewed on the canonical domain.  Google has been confused by the ""mixed signals"" (as our SEO consultant put it) by having each site promote an AMP page on each site the page is viewed on.  While we could update these amphtml link values to always use the canonical location, that wouldn't work for stations sharing content via social media (notably twitter who uses the AMP pages frequently) as the shared page would not be in the station's brand - and thus the station wouldn't get credit for the traffic.

The solution was then to only populate an amphtml link when content is viewed on its canonical domain.  If viewed elsewhere, Twitter would not see the AMP link and would just return the regular version of the content page.

This functionality is already in production on the local sites via AL-4193 - this ticket is just so that iHeart.com knows whether to show an amphtml link or not.  
","21/May/18 9:29 AM;1119767;Yeah, I don't think this accomplishes that goal. The logic that I've implemented based on the description of the ticket is to only show the amp link if a national site was the original publish origin. Amp will still be enabled on every site that syndicates this content.","21/May/18 10:32 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Hmmm, that's not currently the case in production:

https://z100.iheart.com/content/2018-05-21-chrissy-teigen-in-mesh-underwear-reveals-her-post-baby-body-on-instagram/

This content item is owned by Default - the amphtml link is properly suppressed when viewed anywhere other than www.iheart.com

The goal is to be able to associate them with a microsite for enrichment purposes (and have the enriched data appear on the homepage and schedule page as appropriate.

This ticket is to review the implementation that the San Antonio team did to support this, ideally to load the attached .dat into Stage so we can verify the functionality end to end.

If everything looks good, we're done.  If something's off, some collaboration with the San Antonio engineers to get it where it needs to be.

Please find attached revised file with the below changes
 
a)      For all brokered/public Service shows where show Key is null – the show Key =   StationKey + StationScheduleDataKey
b)      For all brokered/public Service shows where show Key is null  - Show =  Note; if note is null as well then we pad it with space “ “
 
Please review
 
Thanks

[A/B tests admin GUI] new creation API and workflow,AR-3844,613747,,Story,Completed,AR,Agile Radioedit,software,howella,,,Px - Unprioritized,Completed,1113313,1110604,1110604,02/Mar/18 3:09 PM,07/Aug/18 8:52 AM,03/May/19 9:49 AM,19/Jul/18 2:19 PM,,2018.7.31,,AB Tester,,,,0,,,,"Current the GUI uses two endpoints to create / replace new tests 
1. *PUT tests/* used by ""REPLACE tests""
2. *POST tests/*  used by ""Create tests""
But the PUT endpoint will not allow a user to create a new revision of a test that is scheduled after the last test ends, in which case user will have to use Create test functionality but it could be cumbersome and error prone to the settings from the existing test. 

I created a new endpoint *POST tests/auto* that can be used combined with the *POST tests/* to enable a new unified workflow for test creation/replace. (This new endpoint will be deployed to staging soon)
The swagger doc of the new *POST test/auto* is here http://stg-abtest.ihrcloud.net/docs/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/assets/swagger.json#/routes/createAuto

So here is the new workflow that should be used for both test creation and replacement, this new workflow has multiple steps. 

step 1, gui uses ""POST tests/"" to post the data of the test to be created. (same as the current create new test action)

step 2, gui gets the response from server. If the response is 200 OK then creation succeeded, no further action needed, if the response status is 409 (means conflict), GUI should display a confirmation modal window, asking if the user wants to terminate the existing conflict test (whose information will be given in the response json body). if the user choses no, creation should be aborted, otherwise go to step 3.
If the response status is either 409 or 200, gui should display the error message and abandon the creation. 

step 3, if the user choose to proceed with terminating conflict test, GUI should use a different endpoint to post the same request, this time it should use ""POST tests/auto"", go to step 2


The ""Create Replacement"" button should use the same workflow above as create a new test. The ""PUT tests/"" should be no longer used by the GUI. 

Also ""Create Replacement"" label should be renamed to ""New Revision"".

Based on how we're currently handing these XML feeds (see comments below for my review with Alex), if there's an article published to all 120 stations' feeds, we're ingesting it on the first one we see it on; and then because that article is already in the system, it's getting skipped on the other 119 feeds as a duplicate.  As such, only 1 of 120 stations gets the desired content.

Looked up each of those items in content tool and found that they existed, but were ingested from another feed.  Example: http://content.radioedit.iheart.com/#/edit/5a96a81508270d578f2e4727?from_list=network

Are there any business rules in place with the ingestion tool that would prevent a piece of content from being ingested if something with the same title already exists?","28/Feb/18 12:39 PM;ccrnyc2msw;Reviewed with Alex, the way the ingestion tool is setup is that it checks the content title and publication date, and uses those values to create a slug.  If it find that the same combination is already in place, it sees it as duplicate content and does skips.

What's happening here is that the Canadian stations are including identical content as per the above criteria in multiple XML feeds.  It's getting ingested on the first station it sees it on, and then skipping the rest.  

Depending on how prevalent this is, we'll likely need to explore ways to either allow duplicate content to be ingested - or perhaps if a piece of duplicate content is found from the same vendor, upon processing the second or subsequent instance, it instead applies an additional brand/topic tag to the existing content item.  ",12/Mar/18 9:40 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Converted ticket into a spike to determine best way to facilitate ingestion of 3rd party content where the same article should be distributed to multiple brands.,"15/Mar/18 1:23 PM;tlong;If we want to keep the content unique in the system (we do), and if we want to have separate feeds setup for groups of stations within the ingestion tool (seems like we do) then what this is is a change in behavior when a duplicate is detected.

If this is already within the content system, instead of saving it again update the targeting then re-publish.

So when these duplicate feeds get run over, the Bell stations will be augmented with the publishing parameters in the ingestion config.","16/Mar/18 9:51 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Another element that Rob and I discussed... each canada station has its own branded website, and they want their version of the content to open on the detail page that has the station's branding.  Very similar to what we're solving in AR-3804 where we want national articles featured on iHeart.com to open in the station's website.","21/Mar/18 6:23 PM;mbrown;Feed content should be considered distinct if the same date and title haven't appeared for that feed.  A way forward would be to change how ingested articles are stored, where the resource id is a hash of feed config id (or some other identifier for the feed), publish date from the feed, and title. No content api change would be required.","22/Mar/18 9:52 AM;mbrown;A potential issue with any fix that allows the same article on multiple feeds to be ingested: if the slug and date are the same across multiple feeds, then the content create API will fail to publish all but one of them. Content's create API should do a pre-check before auto-publishing and respond with 400 if the slug is in use, then ingest would have to alter it with a random string or some such.","11/Apr/18 11:50 AM;tlong;The only feasible way that we can think of to do this is to implement the following:

1. Do not de-dupe content from different feeds based on slug.
2. Prefix or Affix text onto the slug generated from all ingested feeds to make them unique per feed.
3. Publish all content from all feeds into pubsub.

The thing to look out for here is that we'll have 100+ copies of the same article inside of the content system. Additionally, if ingestion publish settings between two feeds were to ever overlap you would see duplicate entries in a station's timeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It looks like newly created content has a social title applied automatically, but what do we do about content created prior to this field being added to the tool?

DB script to apply a social title - or logic in WebApi to supply a fallback title?

I believe on FiRE we have logic in place already to fallback to  the normal title if no social title is specified.

Example:

http://webapi.radioedit.ihrint.com/graphiql/?query=%7B%0A%0A%20%20content%7B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20slug(slug%3A%222018-02-06-billboard-test-stage%22)%20%7B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20payload%20%7B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20social_title%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20summary%20%7B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20title%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%20%20%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%0A%20%7D%0A%0A%7D%0A",,1119767,ccrnyc2msw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WEB-10848,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AR-3780,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20/Mar/18 12:00 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hz7lu7:,9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,Severity 4:  Low,,RadioEdit_06_Friend,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"16/Mar/18 4:31 PM;1119767;I tested with the ""2018-03-15-bon-jovi-live"" slug in dev.","19/Mar/18 8:43 AM;ccrnyc2msw;THis looks good to me on stage.

It seems that the external URL field is not the correct value to use here as that's only available for content that was imported from a 3rd party.  Need to dig into this some more before pulling into a sprint.  ,22/Feb/18 9:33 AM;ccrbdl1mje;[~ccrnyc1rar]?,"22/Feb/18 10:29 AM;ccrnyc1rar;If the RE team would like to do it a different way, that's fine, but adding an external_url is currently the only way www.iheart.com will link out to an external URL instead of displaying the content in www.iheart.com.","05/Mar/18 3:28 PM;ccrnyc2msw;It sounds like there are three use cases we need to solve for:

# O&O station that has its own website where content should open on that station's site.  Example: Z100
# O&O Digital Channel that does NOT have a website and content should open on www.iheart.com or news.iheart.com.  Example: Hit Nation
# 3rd Party station where a content reference is ingested that should open on the 3rd party site.  Example: CHUM-FM

Assuming the above is correct, we currently deliver on #2 and #3 but not #1.  

I don't know if there's any differentiation in Site Manager between #1 and #2, I think historically that difference has been made on the iHeart.com side based on the website value returned from SMT... for stations that don't have a site, the website is set as news.iheart.com.  

Likewise, i don't know that there's a differentiation between O&O stations and 3rd party stations in Site Manager... but on the SMT side, the provider is Clear Channel vs Bell Media.  However, i suppose it's possible that content created on RadioEdit could eventually be published to a 3rd party site (eg, and article about Festival).

Concurrently, we know there is an ask from the Advanced Product Marketing team to start leveraging an external URL for ingested partner content to override the canonical link tag throughout the platform, so I don't believe that basing the WebAPI logic on that field is the way to go.

I think we need a switch in either SMT or Site Manager that allows selection of how to handle external content, either to open on the linked FiRE site, or at the external URL. (content without an external URL could always use a link constructed through the domain from SMT and the slug from WebAPI.)  I could see arguments for doing it in either of those tools.  SMT could be the logical place since it's something iHeart.com specific, primarily to support 3rd party sites... but that would require the addition of logic to iHeart.com since they pull SMT data from AMP and not via WebAPI.  Likewise, Site Manager could be the best place to do it because the links could be constructed by the API... but that arguably is not a ""site"" function since the stations that use it don't have proper sites... which could potentially create additional overhead in the tool and FiRE that the bulk of sites wouldn't leverage.  

[~ccrnyc1rar] [~1113379] [~tlong] what do you guys think?","15/Mar/18 1:36 PM;tlong;Your use cases seem right to me Mike. I don't mind adding stuff to WebAPI for the web team, that's what it's there for,

Does SM contain O&O stations without a website? If not, we could do this:

{code}
1. Pull requested content items from pubsub
    a. Check for external_url, if present copy to ""permalink"" datapoint.
    b. Check for site manager record
        1. if exists copy canonical url to ""permalink"" datapoint.
        2. if missing either leave blank or generate an iheart.com link and add it to ""permalink""
{code}

Then web can key off ""permalink"" always.","16/Mar/18 9:47 AM;ccrnyc2msw;There are O&O stations that don't have a dedicated website, they currently have an SM site for purposes of populating the live profile on iHeart.com - but no user-facing website.  At the moment, SMT is used to cue iHeart.com to generate links to www.iheart.com/news.iheart.com to view content.

Example:

http://site-manager.radioedit.iheart.com/#/brands/site/4249acfb9a388f77eb7e46475e0e6089/Imported/general
http://stream-manager.radioedit.iheart.com/#/streams/4422
https://www.iheart.com/live/hit-nation-4422/

Could this maybe key off of whether a site is active/inactive?  If active, use the primary domain setup in Site Manager - if inactive, use www.iheart.com/news.iheart.com.  I THINK that mirrors the logic built on the local ticket to deactivate sites... SMT returns the site data regardless, and then fire looks for the active/inactive switch to know whether to show the site or redirect to iHeart.com.","16/Mar/18 11:19 AM;ccrnyc2msw;New checkbox/radio/dropdown in Partners>iHeartRadio for ""iHeart.com Editorial Links"" (Help Text: ""Specify whether content shown on this site's iHeart.com profile page opens on iHeart.com or on the station site"")

The issue was that non admin accounts would save an event which would add the proper permissions onto the event / occurrences.

The event save would succeed because of a bug, but the occurrences would get denied.

Until we build a full blown solution in SMT for the long term, we need a script to provision and manage Pivot HLS urls in SMT for the short term.  Pivot Beta goes live *March 26*, so need a way to manage HLS urls for a list of streams, which [~kchoe] will provide.

Pivot HLS urls should be formatted as follows:

1.   Use this prefix: https://us.api.iheart.com/api/v3/adswizzhls/redirect.m3u8?url=  (if in stage, use:  http://us-stg.api.iheart.com/api/v3/adswizzhls/redirect.m3u8?url=)

2.  Take the stations existing HLS url, and URL encode it.  E.g.  https://c7.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com/2153/playlist.m3u8 would look like: https%3A%2F%2Fc7.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com%2F2153%2Fplaylist.m3u8

3.   Add #1 and #2 together to get: https://us.api.iheart.com/api/v3/adswizzhls/redirect.m3u8?url=https%3A%2F%2Fc7.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com%2F2153%2Fplaylist.m3u8

4.   Append the marketId.  E.g.  WBUT-FM is in market 210:  &marketId=210. The resulting final URL is:  https://us.api.iheart.com/api/v3/adswizzhls/redirect.m3u8?url=https%3A%2F%2Fc7.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com%2F2153%2Fplaylist.m3u8&marketId=210

As the director of editorial content, I would like the ability to track which RE user deletes articles from the content system.  

Paul Miraldi provided these two case scenarios:

1 – A piece of content that was written by one of our National Editors mysteriously disappeared from Radio Edit. We have no way of tracking who or why it was deleted.

2-An employee or DJ posts a piece of inappropriate content, perhaps there are complaints via social and they decide to delete it from RE. We have zero evidence that it ever existed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The query functionality under content allows similar behavior.

This was added as a new tab of site manager, however, the functionality is very similar to that of the existing Hide Site option.

We need to make some updates to ensure the deactivate site option plays nicely with the rest of the Site Manager user experience:

# Change ""Hide Site"" page title and nav link to ""Site Status""
# Add module title for existing Hide Site options to ""Temporary Redirect""
# Change Hide Site tooltip to ""Used to temporarily redirect users to an alternate destination. Contact Digital Support for assistance.""
# Make URL redirect field a required field if hide site option is enabled
# Add new module with Deactivate Site functionality with title ""Deactivate Site""
# Add tooltip to Deactivate module ""Permanently disables this site.  Contact Digital Support for assistance""
# Verify/adjust the blue save hide settings button as appropriate so that it matches the new context of the page.
# On brands screen, do not include deactivated sites by default... add option at top to show Inactive sites (under ""All Brand Types"" dropdown?)",,ccrnyc2msw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AR-3544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AR-3514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hzxgrr:,9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,Severity 4:  Low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# Include keywords in the file name that best describe the image being optimized, while being as specific as possible.
#- For file names that include recognizable people (rather than stock characters), include their full name in the image, i.e.: “barack-obama.jpg” not “obama.jpg.” EX: /pictures/barack-obama-1.jpg
#- The same principle applies to places, events, and products. EX: /uploads/2013/09/2013-dodge-durango-RT.jpg
# Use up to 5 words in addition to any numerical values used to identify the image. It is ok to include internal IDs at the end of the filename when necessary. EX: /downloads/tom-cruise-oscars-5284649274.jpg
# Separate multi-word filenames with hyphens as opposed to underscores.
#- Hyphens indicate to the engines that each element is an individual word, whereas elements separated by underscores are combined into one word.",,1110204,ccrnyc1rar,tdrapeau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AR-3907,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|hz7p27:,9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,Severity 4:  Low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20/Mar/18 9:08 AM;1110204;We will need to lay some ground work to require img keywords on upload or determine a process for scanning and identifying images before this can be done.

Some notes:

# Please do the match on legal call sign, which is in the first column (don't match on slug!)
# Do NOT import if site slug ends in -HD
# Please generate a list of any legal call signs for which a match could not be made upon import
# At end of the import, for any sites that are missing a value, set to the corresponding Site Name value.","12/Feb/18 6:00 PM;aroberts;The ""call signs"" present in the updated doc contain duplicates, for example KABQ. I think I also need the broadcast bands.","13/Feb/18 11:46 AM;ccrnyc2msw;I've removed the dupes, this was a result of a bad data import from T2.  I've been cleaning these up in the tool as I activate public files, the ones on the previous list were ones I hadn't gotten to as of when I did the export to generate this list in december.  I've updated the values in the spreadsheet and have also updated in prod SM.  As a result, since dev/stage data is dated, there may be some mis-matches in the non-prod environments.

You shouldn't need the broadcast band... you'll want to key off of this value:

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

You MAY find dupes in SM for the legal call sign field... but those should only be in cases of HD2 stations, which we are excluding via note #2 above.  HD2 stations are intentionally removed from the csv.  ","20/Feb/18 8:55 AM;ccrnyc2msw;Reviewed on dev.  SPot checked about a dozen stations, both AM, FM, and HD, and all the stations had a value to be inserted look good.

However, found an issue with sites that did not have a value in the CSV having the value of ""Master"" for each of the pronouncer fields.  For sites that don't have pronouncer values, these fields should be populated with the site name.

In this case ""www.sportsradiokjr.com"". The links are using https and we do not have ssl certs for all station website domains. This should be fixed in one of three ways:

1) update all streams in SMT to define their website using their actual iheart.com domain such as sportsradiokjr.iheart.com. https protocol works for those.
2) hard-code the links on the station's stream profile page to use http instead of https. FiRE and Fastly will handle all appropriate redirects to the secure station website from there, avoiding the browser's privacy warning message.
3) www.iheart.com should look up the station data by the connected RadioEdit brand in SMT and pull the primary station's URL from there. that would account for any domain changes the station makes in the future.

I think the quick fix would be to do suggestion #1 above, a bulk import of all the current station primary domains and then ensure they get updated on an ongoing basis for future changes.

Long term, #3 is definitely the way to go.  We should only use a domain value provided in SMT if there is no associated FiRE site.

* AC#3 looks good, the features override box has a ""Save Overrides"" button

* Unable to verify AC#5 - the button at the bottom still says ""Delete"".
","20/Feb/18 10:09 AM;1113313;AC2 - this is intentional
AC4 - The language was actually removed in favor of the ""This test can not be edited"" box. Originally there was text at the bottom near the submit button which is now gone
AC5 - If you look at a test after the start date for that test, the button should say Terminate (http://abtest.dev-radioedit.ihrint.com/#/test/edit/5a8c26b215000094538ca9ad)

* Please provide instructions for verifying AC#1

* Verified AC#3 doesn't let you save if there are errors and keeps you on the page
* Verified AC#4 calendar chooser looks good
* AC#5 seems to allow characters beyond what's listed in the AC.  Please verify this is intentional.  
* AC#6 there is a tag field, but it doesn't appear to be leveraging the keywords tags from Taxonomy.  Existing tags are not returned by predictive search, new tags do not appear in Taxonomy.  Please verify this is the intended functionality.  ","20/Feb/18 10:06 AM;1113313;AC1 can be verified by looking at the responses for API calls (see !Screen Shot 2018-02-20 at 10.04.13 AM.png|thumbnail!)
AC5 is intentional, field displays a red ""invalid"" state and won't enable the submit button.
AC6 after some discussion this will not use taxonomy, since we can't dynamically push tags to a specific namespace.

The tags seems not saved. I created a test with one tag, but I am not sure if it's saved since it doesn't show up in subsequence displays of the test. Also it's not obvious to me how to add multiple tags (using comma or space to separate them? )
",22/Feb/18 10:46 AM;1110604;as clarified by [~1113313] the tags are saving I just used it wrong. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes from Trey/Mike's chat on 2/15/18 in italics

*+Publishing content… how do i…+*

# Publish to a homepage regardless of whether a station has subscribed to a particular topic _(Use @home placement in the distribution field in addition to the actual brands/segments)_
# Publish to a homepage only if a station has subscribed to a particular topic _(Select topics plus distribution)_
# Publish only to a microsite for all stations that the microsite has been distributed to? note: microsites don't currently have topic restrictions _(Brand is the microsite… no topic needed)_
# Publish only to a microsite for a subset of stations that have the microsite _(Brand of microsite PLUS brand of parent sites that should get the content)_
# Publish to both the station homepage and the microsite homepage for all stations that have the microsite _(Need to give this some thought. No clear path at the moment)_
# Publish to both the station homepage and the microsite homepage for a subset of stations that have the microsite _(Ditto above, need to give it some thought)_
# Publish something that shouldn't appear on the site or microsite homepage (Solved by new content tool strategy- excluded from timeline)

*+Setup… how do stations…+*

* Opt in/out of topic subscriptions? _(Need to give this some thought. How can stations select which topics they do or don't want  - eg. News talk stations that doesn't want soft news. How to do the queries in a way that doesn't kill site manager. Do we initially launch without topic selection on homepages? How would we weed out content rules that need a topic but shouldn't show up there?)_
* How do microsites get setup to accept the new content? _(If we ignore topics on microsite homepages, there may be no setup for users.

Downside: This will require a significant investment in engineering time to change publishing systems (content, pubsub, site-manager)","07/Mar/18 8:35 PM;tlong;h3. Concept 
The concept on the surface is one of a ""what"" and a ""where"" model.

All items destined for publishing (source) will have zero or more ""whats"", and zero or more ""wheres"".

Whats are things like Topic/Category tags, possibly artist tags and any special tags we decide on for publishing use cases.

Wheres are things like Z100, NEWYORK or A_SEGMENT. They can be specific brands or any tag that represents a group.

Queries or Subscriptions defined in site manager (destination) will follow the same model of What and Where.

The Where tags will be able to be combined with boolean logic. For example, you could say ""(Z100 and Ryan Seacrest) or WKTU"".

h3. Implementation

Content will provide an updated What/Where based interface and a component that allows boolean expressions when selecting tags.

Pubsub will resolve any arbitrarily nested set of boolean expressions to a flat list of strings.

Pubsub will also expand any group tags that come in as the Where. For markets, this means expanding to all sites in that market, for segments it's the same thing. This can generate an enormous amount of possible destinations but since we're just storing it as a plain string array it shouldn't be bad even with several thousand sites.

Site manager will create a data sources editor which follows the same pattern of What/Where. 99% of SM queries should be one or two fixed concepts and require little in the way of change. Additionally, the search list should come down from 250+ to 2-3 which would essentially turbocharge the query system performance wise.

h3. Work

Significant changes to content, pubsub and site manager would be needed. Along with migrations and some new UI components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We need a way to allow national editors to pin a dynamic lead to the first position.

Normally this is used for a ""roadblock"" for a national event announce, such as Festival or Awards.  It's also used for breaking news and for limited duration promotions of live video streams/broadcasts.  The goal is for this to be the first thing a listener sees when they come to the homepage, regardless of whatever else a station might have going on.

Nuances:
# The pinned national DL should be the very first one to show
# A local user should not be shown in the first position when a national pinned DL is live
# Only national editors should be able to add a DL here

I put 2 checkboxes vs 1 so that the RE playlist tool user is forced to confirm whether the playlist is premium or not. I figured this approach demands more intent from the user than a singular box that defaults to ""no"" if user overlooks it and forgets to check it to mark the playlist as premium. I suppose the consequence of a user forgetting to check that box is just that a premium playlist will be made accessible to free users, and only a handful songs will be playable before playback stops. 

I'm not sure what the difference in LOE is between the 2 options, so I'll defer to you. Just wanted to explain the reasoning behind that choice. Let me know!

It's the only boolean option that doesn't match the way we display all the other boolean options.  We let everything else have a reasonable default, whether on or off, and present it as a toggle.  If you're afraid of playlists being non-premium by default, then let's just make the default premium, which would prevent that issue from occurring.  As it stands, it makes for awkward UI.

I propose switching it to a toggle to match all the other toggles.  [~1110204] [~1112284] can you please comment?","07/Feb/18 2:17 PM;1112284;Hey [~gvilches], thanks for providing that! I see your point, it doesn't flow as nicely. I'm fine with having it be defaulted to ""Premium"" as a toggle. If [~1110204] is fine with this approach as well, I will update the A/C. ","07/Feb/18 2:27 PM;1110204;Yay, lets move forward with the change and default to Premium. Thanks!","07/Feb/18 2:29 PM;1112284;Done, thanks [~gvilches]!","16/Feb/18 11:26 PM;1112284;Hey [~gvilches] Do you need anything else from me for this ticket? Let me know when it's ready for review, thanks! ","23/Feb/18 3:38 PM;1112284;Toggle looks great, though I wasn't able to check that all Thumbs Up playlists were marked as Premium. It wasn't clear when Gabe, Matt, Amit and I originally discussed whether that was something we would do ourselves after the control was enabled, which I'd be happy to do but I'm currently not able to see other playlists in that tool right now. Would you know or be able to check [~gmiller]? ","23/Feb/18 3:57 PM;1112284;Never mind, Rob gave me access to view other playlists! Looks like all existing playlists have been updated with the Premium field defaulted to Yes. I'd failed to consider how default state would impact existing playlists since I was only thinking of how that control would look when creating a new playlist. Seeing this now, I'm thinking it may be better to have it defaulted to ""No"" since most playlists would not be premium, and then just having Thumbs Up playlists updated to ""Yes."" I'll update the A/C so default is ""No"", but let me know if you disagree [~gmiller]","23/Feb/18 4:21 PM;1112284;Gabe agreed, so updated A/C and assigning back to [~gvilches]. Thanks!

It looks like default state is correctly set to ""Not Premium"" for new playlists, but I'm still seeing existing playlists on https://playlists.radioedit.ihrint.com defaulted to ""Premium"" (ex: 92.1 The Beat Playlist, 1045 KISS FM Playlist, BIG 105.9 Miami Playlist etc.). Those playlists should have been updated as well, right? 

Also, for all the Thumbs Up playlists, is there a way for you to update them in bulk so that they are all marked as premium? ","05/Mar/18 11:31 AM;gvilches;I did not apply any changes to any playlists that may have already had an existing setting.  I checked on http://playlists.radioedit.ihrint.com/#/playlist/%2F5a453da1afd8c0000171100f for an example (Eagle 102.3) and it showed me the Premium Playlist is off.

Once we're happy with the behavior, we can update the setting for whichever lists you want.  Can you please confirm that the playlists you want to set as premium all have the words ""Thumbs Up"" in the title?  Do you want all the others explicitly set to not premium?","05/Mar/18 12:46 PM;1112284;Yes, confirmed. Thanks [~gvilches]!

Offhand, seeing a number of props that are keying off of the origin value that should not be.  

http://content.dev-radioedit.ihrint.com/#/edit/5a6f3dae788046e78fa25417

The following props should always use IHM-IP related values since Apple News is served under the iHeartRadio brand.

Also seeing that h1 and h2 have colons separating the values, these should be commas.

{code:java}

    ""c6"": ""MIKE-DV"",
    ""c7"": ""CORPORATE"",

    ""h2"": ""CORPORATE:ROCKALTERNATIVE"",
    ""v6"": ""MIKE-DV"",
    ""v7"": ""CORPORATE"",
    ""v8"": ""ROCKALTERNATIVE"",
{code}

Expected values: (note, format-based values are stripped as IHM-IP does not have a format)

    ""c2"": ""news.iheart.com"",

","30/Apr/18 9:20 AM;gvilches;A couple questions that have come up during development of this feature:

1) Are the swaps immediately applied to the dynamic playlist?  As in, the knowledge of the base track is gone, and only the swapped track is left, so there's no way to see that it is a swap?
2) If the answer to (1) is no, is there an expectation that the swap is somehow presented in the custom playlist, or only applied during AMP publish?","30/Apr/18 9:58 AM;gmiller;Hey [~gvilches]

1.) I was hoping the track swap would be immediately applied to the dynamic playlist Track Builder window, and then be applied to the front-end upon playlist publication. 
2.) Not sure I fully understand this one, but as long as Admin Curators can manage (add, update, remove) the full list of swaps (AC #3) there doesn't need to be special presentation for the track swap in the track listing UI","30/Apr/18 10:26 AM;gvilches;Based on your answers, we're not going to keep a history of how the track got swapped, we're just going to swap it, and won't visually indicate to users that any swap actually occurred on the playlist in future views.  Let me know if that needs changing.",30/Apr/18 10:32 AM;gmiller;Sounds acceptable to me!,"07/May/18 4:12 PM;gmiller;Adding a swap functionality is looking from the Swaps window (http://playlists.radioedit.ihrint.com/#/swaps). When adding the swap, it immediately updates the content in the track lists. However, when removing a swap I need to refresh my browser in order for the removal to take effect. Possible to look in that [~gvilches]?","08/May/18 11:29 AM;gvilches;That’s just a quirk of behavior in the UI not forcing swaps immediately.  If anything, swap deletion will result in the swap being left in place in the playlist if we were to make swap changes instantaneous.

Here’s what’s happening behind the scenes:
1) A swap is added to the swaps list; no playlists are changed at this time

Workflow A) A playlist is viewed in the UI
  2A) Swaps are immediately applied to the playlist view; they are not yet saved
  3A) if you do nothing, the swaps are not committed to the playlist yet; if you do, they are, permanently and irrevocably

Workflow B) you publish a playlist without looking at it
  2B) swaps are immediately and irrevocably applied

Workflow C) the DS team pushes a new playlist track set into the API
  2C) swaps are immediately and irrevocably applied

I acknowledge that (A) represents an inconsistent approach relative to (B) and (C).  There’s a couple ways we can address this, but before I propose any, I’m open to feedback about what your expectations are.
","08/May/18 6:52 PM;gmiller;I think I understand. I agree with the logic in the workflows you outlined, and definitely observed those in the case of adding swaps.

In the event that a swap was deleted and then all of the Dynamic Playlists were Bulk Published (most similar to Workflow B, I suppose) would the playlists published to users contain the deleted swap or not?","15/May/18 12:06 PM;gmiller;Hey [~gvilches], anything else for me to review or test here?","15/May/18 5:43 PM;gmiller;Hey [~gvilches], [~ccrnyc2msw] asked me to take a look at this since this is in PM review state now.

We can go to prod without it if needed.","30/May/18 10:08 AM;gmiller;Thanks [~gvilches], I'd like to be able to test end to end in staging.

A browser will hit fastly every 6 hours looking for an update to the image, and fastly will continue returning the same image for 14 days before asking the origin.
