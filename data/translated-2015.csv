At least 35 minutes elapses before the user hears a second sweeper -- this goes cross-station at the user level (for example, if a user hears a sweeper play in the Rolling Stones station and then switches to the Beatles station, they are not eligible to hear another sweeper on the Beatles station for 35 minutes after the last sweeper play.
8.	When multiple sweepers are available for a station, they should play back according to the priority logic: back-to-back, artist station, format, artist play, track play; then by priority and then by date playing the oldest active sweeper first and working forward.
9.	The metadata for pre-existing sweepers can be edited, including the start and end dates, in the RE tool; the change should be reflected on the front end within 10 minutes
10.	 The tool contains a list of existing sweepers; the list contains the following parameters: title, date created, start date, end date, publish date; be default the list is organized alphabetically but the list can be resorted by any of the parameters

Would be great to have container level additional attributes possible in Schedules. Here are the containers we created in Lead Scheduler to get the functionality we need for launch:
* Kids ‚Äì The main station list that appears on the home/browse screen, this is akin to a DL
* Kids-homescreen ‚Äî if there is a custom background image we want to merchandise (like for a sponsor) for the home/browse screen, image is 16x9 aspect
* Kids-homescreen-4x3 ‚Äî same as above, image is 4x3 aspect
* Kidssponsorship ‚Äî At app start, we show a splash screen with animated transition to the home/browse screen, this is for a sponsorship image to put on the splash screen, 16x9 aspect
* Kidssponsorship-4x3 ‚Äî same as above, image is 4x3 aspect
* Kids-station-background ‚Äî if there is a custom background on the player screen (like for a sponsor), image is 16x9 aspect. This could have been folded into kids, but we decided to have a separate container for this as we have different teams doing station programming and sponsor images
* Kids-station-background-4x3 ‚Äî same as above, image is 4x3 aspect
* Kids-sounds ‚Äî for future use, these have sounds made by the kids during Bug Bash, we‚Äôll find a placement for them after launch
* Kids-show-nowplaying ‚Äî serves as a whitelist for now playing metadata, some stations have inappropriate song titles and/or cover art, so now playing info is only shown for stations if the station is in this list.

If Schedules could allow for:
* Items with attachments but without images
* Images with 2 different aspect ratios
* Attributes like ‚Äúshow now playing‚Äù

We had to lose the category support for P4. This was due to the way the activities existed in the buckets which leveraged a single global category config file which wouldn't work across regions. We determined that in all environments the categories were hardly used at all so instead of incurring a huge engineering cost we just dropped the feature as it seemed like a small loss.

To make up for the loss of the categories feature we added two new filters to P4. The first is a filter to show only Published (or live) activities. This was how the categories were used primarily in the old P4 so now it's automatic. Secondly we added a ""now"" filter which shows activities that are scheduled to be active at the current time.

Additionally there is still work to be done before we can consider this released for multi-region support. Primarily some sort of region marker on the activities themselves. When a client or website asks for P4 information they get the entire DB of published and current activities. We need an additional metric to split on if we want to keep the region sandboxed.",,,,,,,,,

I am considering the replacement project a high profile priority for the RadioEdit dev team, and it will begin taking some of the team‚Äôs capacity in Sprint 13 (starting tomorrow). The version of mediaserver that is currently live is believed to already be equivalent in functionality to what exists for iscale. We will also likely need to bulk up the RadioEdit farm to cope with the traffic (it was said that iscale is taking 6000 req/sec). To help us gauge both of these, we need OPS help to:
1. Get access logs from iscale server(s) to help us determine how the request load is distributed today. We‚Äôll double check that all URL styles are supported by mediaserver. (in progress)
2. Hatch a plan to push n% of iscale‚Äôs traffic to mediaserver, to gauge the effects on the RadioEdit farm (dependent on #1)
If dev can assist with each one of these tasks, let us know. If these tasks are acceptable, Marta if you wouldn‚Äôt mind ticketing them in AO, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

Custom Images Should Never Render as 2x2,IHRAR-637,103162,,Story,Completed,AR,Completed,GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com,coreykahn@iheartmedia.com,coreykahn@iheartmedia.com,12/May/15 10:32 AM,10/Dec/15 2:51 PM,10/Dec/15 2:51 PM,,,,,,,,"As a Perfect For stakeholder, I want custom images to always appear as a solo image and never as a 2x2 tile.

Moving this into a ticket from a lengthy email back and forth... I know it's been discussed that a tile image only gets generated if the following query returns nothing:
SELECT DISTINCT station_image as image
FROM [RadioModel].[playlist].[station_image] with (nolock)
WHERE station_id = :id

And the view it's looking at is:
SELECT s.playlist_id,
  station_id = pgstation_id,
  playlist_name,
  image = ISNULL(ISNULL(playlist_image_override,atb.imagepath),st.station_image),
  station_image = st.station_image,
  playlist_image_override,
  album_image = atb.imagepath
FROM RadioModel.playlist.playlist_name s  WITH(NOLOCK)
     LEFT JOIN RadioModel.playlist.playlist_cover scp  WITH(NOLOCK) ON (s.playlist_id = scp.playlist_id)
     LEFT JOIN IHRDWH..amw_track t WITH(NOLOCK) ON scp.productid = t.productid
     LEFT JOIN IHRDWH..amw_track_bundle atb  WITH(NOLOCK) ON t.trackbundleid = atb.productid
LEFT JOIN Radiomodel.playlist.msplaylist_to_pgstation_mapping m WITH(NOLOCK) ON s.playlist_id = m.msplaylist_id
     LEFT JOIN IHRDWH..station st  WITH(NOLOCK) ON m.pgstation_id = st.station_id

So theoretically, it appears that as long as playlist_image_override in radiomodel.playlist.playlist_name is not null, then a 2x2 tile should not get made at all. However, a 2x2 tile is getting rendered at first, even when an image URL is in that field, which we then have to wait for the cache to break to clear. Something doesn't seem to be quite right.

Slony can take up to a day to make the full path from MSSQL -> PGSQL -> other MSSQL tables.

Potential solutions: 
1) This view is not potentially necessary now that everything comes directly from Mongo.  If we could have the publishing process skip fetching from the station_image view, we could put the correct image in play immediately.
2) Fixing the station image view to not depend on the IHRDWH.station table.  This might require an additional publishing timestamp or record to identify what's safely published and what's not yet.

I'm leaning to (1) since that requires less moving parts, we just have to replace the station_image view logic in the publishing P4 application side.",,,,,

1) Catalog search should propagate as many fields as possible after doing a lookup, including new fields like the image ""field""

2) The Library is intended to save a user's work, so they don't need to re-enter things, particularly for custom slides like contests or promotions, or recurring slides like Festival promos

If we pre-populate the Library with everything in the catalog, I imagine we'd fill up the library to the point of being unusable for custom slides.  More importantly, we'll run into parity issues when the catalog changes.  The nice thing about populating slides via catalog lookup is the contents will always be current, including stations that were just created (which also typically are the most common stations to promote).",,,,,,,,

NOTES:
* registry needs to be moved to a global location
* returns are stdout
* debug, logs, status, progress are stderr
* APPID should probably be optional if you're in a directory with a service.yml
* appid (clientid) is the one true application identifier
* verson id is the id of the particular build and is made from the first N bytes of the sha for the image
* instance id is the id of the running container and is also make from the container id
* APPID will need to be stored in the YML file
* possibility: alias primary application version to ""current"" on proxy e.g. current.api.re.qa.cl.ihr
* we should have a routine to validate the YML in this new binary

However, it would be great to post a dismissable error back to the user letting them know that the field must be numeric. The dismissable error box would appear when a user clicks the ""Modify"" button. Otherwise, the user will quickly get confused when the ""Modify"" button doesn't respond to the click with no explanation",27/Feb/15 9:27 AM;AlexMamut@iheartmedia.com;Added message to content id field validation error.,19/Mar/15 10:10 AM;con-nyc1tlc;This actually breaks ability to insert in link types,"19/Mar/15 10:10 AM;con-nyc1tlc;Rob has asked to make sure this doesn't get pushed to Prod
",19/Mar/15 10:17 AM;AlexMamut@iheartmedia.com;The problem Rob is seeing is that when existing keywords without content Id's are modified the modify button is disabled because of the validation on content id. This is an issue with feedback. I put the validation on the field when I should have put it on the entire form. Either open a new ticket or reopen this one and I will fix.,"19/Mar/15 10:19 AM;RobRowe@iheartmedia.com;Makes sense, how does this look?
