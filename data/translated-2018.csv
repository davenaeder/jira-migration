Observed that a new error message is shown at the top of the page upon a user's first load of a new content item.  Some notes:

1) We shouldn't show an error to users every time they try to create a new item.  Can this be changed to only appear when a user hits the save button?

2) ""Required"" text on individual fields is not consistent.  On the headline, it's all lowercase, on primary image and blocks, it's Sentence Case.  Please make this uniform.  I prefer sentence case.

3) Item has errors at the top does not show an error pertaining to the primary image not being present.  We should specifically call that out.

4) If you insert a block but leave it blank, ""There was an unknown error"" appears.  Please update this to be more specific.

5)  If you have multiple blocks that are blank/have errors, we should explicitly call them out.  Can we reference the block type and corresponding error?  Ex, Gallery Block - Missing Title","11/Dec/18 1:36 PM;MarkCahill@iheartmedia.com;1. No, because we prevent save until the content item is valid
2. Will do.
3. Primary image is not marked as required in the template. The error you're seeing is just saying that the url is required in order for the image to be valid.
4. I'll look into it.

Often these responses return a category like this web url: http://iheart.com/genre/rock-12/. This works fine for devices with screens but not for voice interactions like on Alexa which often error and would do better if the user is taken to a specific station.

*Example Use Case*

{quote}104.6 KISS FM is a top 40 station with Elvis Duran mornings, Jane Smith middays, Ryan Seacrest afternoons, and John Doe evenings.  The station is secretly planning to blow up the station tomorrow at 11AM; there should be no advance indication to listeners that a change is happening. Most staff members at the station will probably also be unaware that the station is being rebranded.  At 11AM on the day of the change, the station is turning into 104.6 The Bull (a country station).  Jane Smith and John Doe are laid off as they are top 40 DJs and we want them gone off the site ASAP since they are no longer in our employ.  Elvis Duran and Seacrest are still with the company, but aren't a part of the new station, so they should be gone as well.  Any reference to the KISS FM on-air schedule should be removed once 11AM hits.  The call letters of the station will remain the same after the change, so they'll continue to use the same site in Site Manager.{quote}

*Current Setup and Pain Points*

At the present, we get one dump a day from CORE that is processed during the overnight hours.  That means stations can either blank the schedule the day before (not preferred as the programmers feel it will show their hand), or deal with old station's on-air schedule continuing to be visible until the CORE import runs the next morning.

This schedule data is used to populate 1) the station homepage module, 2) the station schedule page, and 3) Flagship via WebAPI.

*Desired Functionality*

If a station changes formats at 11AM, we need the existing schedule to show until 11AM, at which time, we can go in and remove the schedule.  Realistically, if CORE can give us updates more than once a day, we'd want to show that, but in the interim, blowing out or hiding the existing data would be the way to go.

*Potential Approaches*

Do we add an option to suppress the schedule in Site Manager (where an admin would need to go turn it back on at a later date), or do we instead focus on blanking the schedule (that would remain blank until the import job next runs)?

The collection lookup on WebAPI already obviously exists, but would need to accept the catalog type + ID values - (matching the catalog attach on the leads cards) and based on a match of all 3, return whatever data is needed via the Leads query of webapi.

Downstream, there's be a page that would render to users.  If there was a match via WebAPI, it'd use the data returned from that call... else, it would pass the same catalog type and ID number to AMP and get it from there.


Example card:
http://leads.radioedit.ihrint.com/#/edit/5bdc96cafef4767f0d17a9fd
This would be an override of the Classic Soul playlist.

for test purposes, i used collections/vadim-test

My initial tests were not successful, with a local user (QA2) being able to edit a playlist created by a national user (QA3) with no specific editor tags applied.  This does not seem to be working.

Created http://playlists.radioedit.ihrint.com/#/playlists/playlist/%2F5c3de2a411b55c94af6c516b as QA3 which is a super user

Seeing all sorts of unexpected editor tags appear here:

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Since this playlist was created by a super user, it should have whatever tag allows super users to edit everything (Providers/Playlist Admin?) and any other tags that may have been applied by the user at time of creation/update.  I don't understand where all these other tags are coming from or what their significance is.","15/Jan/19 11:49 AM;YehudaRosen@iheartmedia.com;For these two particular users, one is listed as a member_of another - http://auth.radioedit.ihrint.com/api/principals/user/ldap/svc-RadioEditQA3 - which is (one reason) why QA2 can edit QA3's playlist.

The AC in this particular ticket should be met, but I changed the order of operations when a playlist is saved so all those tags are visible in the editors field. We should look into removing this in favor of using actual taxonomy terms (e.g. brands, providers, etc) but as a quick workaround, would this logic work?

1) Playlist Admin users can read & edit anything
2) Everyone else can read everything, but only edit playlists they created
2a) I might be able to improve the editors field logic so that multiple people could be added without the other stuff, but I'm not sure how reliable that is without trying it out","15/Jan/19 3:48 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;1 looks correct
2 seems different than the editor tagging that's in leads/content (and has been the focus of all the tickets related to this work).  I'd really like this to match the brand/provider tag setup that our users and support team are accustomed to.
2a sounds problematic given the discussions we had around content presets and dpd's having the user permission so they could delegate permission to their staff (eg, a dpd would be able to edit any/all playlists that has anything from the user namespace tagged on it)",16/Jan/19 10:34 AM;AlexMamut@iheartmedia.com;From what [~1113313] has told me the primary AC of this ticket has been addressed and deployed to stage.

so when people go to the category page with a category attached to the end (ie. /category/alternative-medicine-and-history) it will look up content tagged against that tag in taxonomy, which unblocks PN-2954.

I was able to save the path variable in SM so this looks good from my end.

First, you can absolutely add an artist tag in the keyword field. Are you wanting artist distributions to show up in the keywords field?

How can we engineer this so users only have to tag an artist in one location, and use that tag to power both distribution to artist profiles and the topic tag shown on the content detail pages?

Re: example above, yes, that's a legit test case, except that the editor shouldn't have to tag the artist on 2 different screens.","30/Oct/18 8:35 AM;MarkCahill@iheartmedia.com;Then they should only tag artists in distribution, and we should legitimately remove artists from keywords. Do you still want me to combine artists in distribution with the rest of the keywords returned by webapi, though?","30/Oct/18 8:39 AM;MarkCahill@iheartmedia.com;Namespaces are template-controlled, so I removed the artists namespace from the article template in dev.","30/Oct/18 8:44 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Correct.  Now we need a way for a user who has permission to artists to be able to tag only in the distribution box, but populate the keywords field in webapi with those tagged artists so that the link to the artist profile is shown at the bottom of the body.

The issue is indeed that Apple does not support a straight up video embed, but does support when included in a post.  We've significantly improved the Apple News validation messaging to call out that this is not supported and steer users to include the video in a post- and then use that post in the article as an embed block.

In the course of this ticket, we also significantly humanized all the Apple News-related validation messages.

This relates to the domain that is included in the canonical url for each article. This submission process requires the site to have a minimum readership as defined by a minimum amount of outbound traffic FROM Facebook TO that domain. This means we can not use a test site for testing. I would need to write up dev/stage to the corporate iHeartRadio Facebook page, and just rely on environment variables to set development_mode=true to hide them from our Facebook users. This sounds shady as hell.","22/Oct/18 11:22 AM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;New strategy.

[~1119767] get with me to discuss.

We will use the national news feed (news.iheart.com) to create articles to FB IA. We can do this by understanding what ""where's"" are considered national.

The news.iheart.com page should have more than enough ""viewership"" to start a test.

After we master getting articles from our tools to FB IA then we can discuss further how individual pages get those articles.","22/Oct/18 11:25 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;For any changes made on the FiRE front end to support this, let's make sure we get WEB and WebAPI tickets lined up and prioritized since most of the content national creates is canonical (and redirects to) www.","22/Oct/18 11:34 AM;MarkCahill@iheartmedia.com;That's a good point. Since www is the canonical url, the fire work to expose the page id needs to be done in web as well.","13/Nov/18 10:22 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;It looks like iHeart.com has both a page id and app ID already on their content detail pages.

Does Facebook provide any information on their required traffic benchmarks? The iHeartRadio FB page has had 89,163 Page Views, 24,453 Page Likes and 4,948,799 Post Engagements over the past four weeks (10/15-11/11).

","13/Nov/18 3:06 PM;MarkCahill@iheartmedia.com;Yeah, which is why I needed access to the prod Facebook page instead of a test page. Our test page had 0 shares per month. Now that I have access, I can move forward with coding a solution.

We will still need to choose an editor for when this goes to production, or else once we start actually publishing Facebook Instant articles on the iHeartRadio FB page, I'll be listed as the author.","13/Nov/18 3:31 PM;MattBerger@iheartmedia.com;Okay, I currently see you listed as a Pending admin for the iHeartRadio Facebook page.

No, I need to use a user token to post Facebook Instant articles. It is one of my biggest complaints with the system so far. In a later phase, when we expose this in RadioEdit, we'll use an OAuth2 flow to allow any site admin to log in with their Facebook login as long as they have access to the station's Facebook page. However, in phase 1 we'll have to nominate someone to be the Facebook Instant editor.",13/Nov/18 4:04 PM;MattBerger@iheartmedia.com;You can use your own admin account or you're welcome to use my account. Let me know how I'd provide that token.

The urls being shared to the iHeartRadio Facebook page are from ihr.fm, a url shortening service. That means that when trying to register www.iheart.com as a canonical domain, it is being rejected for low traffic volume, because the metrics from the iHeart Facebook page are tied to ihr.fm. Even if we stop using this service now, which we likely should if we want to proceed with Facebook Instant, it would take some period of time for Facebook to consider www.iheart.com ""worthy"" of Facebook Instant. In speaking with [~mberger], he suggests talking to Paul Miraldi and Jeff Cucinell and working something out. The plan of action that makes the most sense to me is to switch the share urls, then try again in a month or so.",11/Dec/18 1:03 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;I'll discuss with Paul.

Found that for some reason, a few sites may have a second /pay source redirect, but this seems to be the exception rather than the rule.  Because stations can delete extra redirects - and fire uses the first one it comes across - and the old billpay site redirects to the new one, we're not going to solve for this.

I'm not sure this works as is since here is no single brand tag that all editors have access to (nor do I know if that would be appropriate to do).

My first hunch is to give an option that allows template editors to specify whether a template is available to all users - or to just those from the tagged brands.

The above setup does introduce a small security loophole - but that can be mitigated by sysadmins not delegating permission to users (other than users/authenticated for templates that everyone should see).  Once we implement the app-based security this should resolve itself and no longer be an issue.  I'll be notating in the documentation as such.

* You have a few places with things like ""provide benefits such as providing"" which could use some streamlining.
* I'm not entirely sure what your third diagram is showing me
* There are a few places you make reference to things which you expect your audience to know, such as ""Facade pattern"" which you provide a link to, but it might help to include a summary of what it is
* Similarly concepts like ""resolvers"" ""schemas"" ""data loaders"". You and I work with those day to day, but some interested parties may not know them by those names
* You have a section called ""Documenting your apis"" where you make reference to api docs, but then only talk about the playground. the graphiql app thing had a kind of interactive documentation of the params that the endpoint was looking for for different queries. I don't know if the apollo playground has something like that, but might be worth a mention.
* Your conclusion (always the hardest part) seems... I dunno, kinda clunky. Reads like a TLDR. I dunno, I just feel like I could not read it and come away with the same info.
* Another consideration is try to minimize blind links. You have things like ""report errors"" as link text, and I can assume it's going to documentation of that feature or something, but no real description.
In that particular case, maybe saying ""GraphQL solves this problem much more elegantly by allowing resolvers to report errors to the client without terminating the entire request, [link] as documented here[/link]

Users can put whatever they want in there; we have no association between content created by the same author or the ability to show any metadata about a given author.

How can we maintain support for the existing freeform/throwaway author value (for legacy content), while allowing frequent contributors to tag using a re-usable value?

Some considerations:

* Author name does not usually equal AD user name
* One AD user may pen under multiple author names
* Multiple AD users may pen under a single author name
* We'll need permissioning so that users don't create content under the name of someone else without their consent
* We still need to support one-off values that aren't likely to be re-used such as a sponsor that provides a single piece of branded content - or ingested content (from billboard or the like) where it can be a slew of different authors that don't repeat often)
* It'd be a beast to manually create 2,500 author profiles - and a mess if we ask 2,500 authors who frequently typo to do it themselves

We'd want the ability to supply metadata for an author... things like email, twitter, facebook, phone, short bio, picture, etc.

What is the best way to organize this data and tool it?  What updates need to be made to the APIs and clients to support across all platforms (including Apple News, AMP, etc)

","19/Sep/18 11:08 AM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;If you're willing to lose all content published to this brand and permission to edit any content using this brand as an editor and if you're willing to disassociate any streams data, leads data, calendar events, user permissions and charts we can rename these.

This is basically creating a new site, which is something the system supports and is a today solution.","19/Sep/18 11:25 AM;MarkEscott@iheartmedia.com;instead of renaming the tag, can we swap out the value of ""own_brand"" to the new tag, leaving the old brand tag untouched? we can keep the old brand as a segment of the site to allow content to continue loading.","04/Oct/18 4:38 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;From [~mbrown] on HipChat:

changing a microsite's brand tag is going to cause its timeline items under a site to link direct to the site and not have the microsite as the eyebrow. If that's undesireable, we'll need an AL ticket to smooth that over.‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ(I'm going to be storing the previous brand tags used, in the event of a change, just like with slugs.

I don't think this is a huge deal.  Content times off the homepage so quickly that it's not even worth updating.  Worst case scenario they see the content on an unbranded content detail page.","05/Oct/18 11:45 AM;MarkEscott@iheartmedia.com;At the current time there's no need to change a microsite brand tag, just a site","09/Oct/18 8:39 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Tested on dev.

Changed slug and brand on http://site-manager.dev-radioedit.ihrint.com/#/brands/site/5b2411e558848f7fb38219da/Default/general

+The following look good to my eyes:+
* Confirmed that slugs/tags already in use error out
* Confirmed that with a new unique slug/tag, it saves
* Observed past slug and brand tag were retained as additional values
* Confirmed new brand tag is created
* Old brand tags can be deleted from site

+Unsure how to verify the following: ([~mbrown], please advise)+
* ""clean up archived_brands if the new value also exists in the archive ""
* ""add the new value to -segments and- lookup structure""
* ""add the old value to segments"" (on the test example, the former brand tag does not appear in additional segments
* ""remove the old name from -segments and- lookup structure""

[9:26 AM] Matt Brown: You can test the lookup structure with a config call, e.g. site-manager.radioedit.ihrint.com/api/v1/config2?brand=<tag>
[9:27 AM] Matt Brown: The archived_brands cleanup...I tested that by changing the brand to a different name, and then back to what it was. The original name is then removed from the old-brands list on the general page for the site
[9:28 AM] Matt Brown: For your third bullet, you're probably running up against the bug where the index data isn't refreshed on save. If you refresh after the brand change, you'll see the old one in additional segments","09/Oct/18 2:05 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Tested config calls:

Both return the expected results.

Custom cache service:

Level 1 features:
	- HTTP interface (or HTTP/2)
		- What does this look like? How are complex commands done if at all?
		- HTTP is great for portability and client support, we just need a sane way of using it.
	- Group key invalidation, aka surrogate keys, aka cache tagging.
		- Done through abstraction with redis plus lua trash collection?
	- Easy distributed locks
	- Easy dogpile prevention (always on)

Level 2 features:
	- Callthrough caching (aka CDN mode)
		a proxy http request that is cached transparently. This is like a CDN, but local...
		- advantages:
			- doesn't have to go out to the world
			- doesn't depend on external services
			- can provide a keep-warm routine if it continues to be requested
				e.g. x-refresh-after header causes api endpoint to be re-fetched. Only happens once unless another request that has x-refresh-after set comes in.
		- disadvantages:
			- takes our resources

		Research and implement something like APQ from Apollo for this perhaps.

If Adswizz's servers are down (eg. 504/request timeout), it blocks users from approving changes made to streams.

We need to explore ways to make the Streams tool not dependent on 3rd parties such as Adswizz.  If upon approving a change, Adswizz is not available, the rest of the changes should go through, but users should be alerted that Adswizz is down and be given the option to re-try.

Would the solution we built for Apple News in the Content Tool work here as well?  There, upon publishing a piece of content that is intended for Apple News, the content is immediately published - and a request is triggered to Apple News. Users are shown that the Apple push is pending.  Upon successful transmission to Apple, we update the indicator in the publish panel as such.

If the attempt succeeds its removed from the queue else stays in the queue and moves onto the next item.

This would delay the Adswizz updates but not keep the user locked out of accepting stream changes. The user would not need to do anything extra and the change would get pushed eventually (as long as Adswizz API can process the request).

Right Solution:
The FAC catalog we're using is no longer updated. Not to mention AMP would prefer it if we didn't look into the database directly as it's a complex set of data that they manage fairly carefully. The preference would be to use an existing catalog export system and add an artist export to that. Which would dump an easily parsable file to S3 that we could pick up periodically.

We were also asked to give an overview as to where and how the artist namespace in the taxonomy is used.

Fast Solution:
If this is a serious issue the AMP team can copy the current view of the data to the mongo database we've been using as a stop-gap measure.",18/Sep/18 10:30 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Trey is going to ping the group from last week to make sure the AMP work is moving forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Did some further testing with MX selected as the country and found that live stations associated with a provider that is not available in MX (eg. Clear Channel) do not show up in search results for both Leads and Content.

However, it doesn't look like we ever built out country support for lookups in the Search Overrides tool.  That appears to be pulling the US catalog regardless of which country is selected (and there is no option to select a country in the search modal).  I suspect this is no better or worse than what is currently in place for CA that it shouldn't block launching MX.  As such, if you wanted to setup a search override for a catalog item that doesn't exist in US, you'd need to manually supply link/title/etc.

Created IHRAR-4614 to upgrade to the current catalog lookup, but given that I haven't heard any complaints from CA on this, not sure how urgent it is.  

Attempted to also test podcast, artists, and tracks - but as Mexico hasn't yet been setup as a country in Custom Talk Prod, can't test podcasts.  And from talking with Chris Graham, artists and tracks are not planned for MX, so unable to test those.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately this had the unintended side effect of causing www.iheartradio.com to also redirect to news.iheart.com/news, since that is a secondary domain on IHM-IP... and the way FiRE is built, a secondary domain will always redirect to the primary domain before doing anything else.  This caused users going to www.iheartradio.com from marketing materials to reach the news page instead of the www homepage.  As such, the fastly update was rolled back.

Need to solve for the following use cases:

*+news.iheart.com+*
# root / should 301 redirect to https://news.iheart.com/news
# standard content detail pages should 301 redirect to the www.iheart.com version of the page

# standard content detail pages should 301 redirect to the www.iheart.com version of the page
# all other pages should behave like normal fire sites and serve on IHM-IP/news.iheart.com... 

Worth nothing that for subpages on www.iheartradio.com, since this domain hasn't been primary in years, all links of value likely hit the redirect tool already - which can be done both on the FiRE side and on the www side.

3. Not getting a duplicate notification/error when I enter an existing RSS URL. 
4. While not a requirement, also, would it be possible to make the artwork thumbnails smaller in the Preview screen. Right now they are fairly large, so by going a little smaller, it will streamline the over lists of shows that appear on that screen. But this is just a personal perference.

I still don't think this is working.

If the existing genre is Classic Rock, that's what should be shown on the Stream screen.  Updating another data point on the stream should not cause the genre to change to default.

Confirmed that I can now apply a market and brand to a stream even if I don't have permissions to those in Taxonomy - based on the global-admin permission.

Removed the global-admin permission and confirmed that I can't access any streams - and can only create streams for brands and markets that I have permission to via user manager.  However, noticed, that even with permission to a market, I can't see streams associated with that market (eg. gave NEWYORK-NY market permission, but don't see any of the streams that are associated with that market in my list.  Not sure that this is a common use case as stream management isn't really done at the market level.

Added country-admin to the same user and confirmed that without a country permission, there are no functional options within the tool.  Add countries/US and confirmed that all US streams are visible - as well as changes/markets/etc.  Also confirmed that within streams I can add any US-based market or brand (but not any canada brands or markets).

Found an issue where provider admins cannot currently apply markets to their stations, which blocks them from saving.  Discussed with Greg whether the preference was to allow selection of any market - or to individual permission markets to each provider's admin and decided on the former.  Created IHRAR-4316 to address, but that's not a blocker for launch as domestic provider admins aren't getting access to this tool immediately.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal is to base permissions on what we currently have in Content and Leads where one or more editor tag is applied to a playlist.

Playlists editors could be brands or providers just like leads... we'd also look to add a namespace for record labels (eg. so that we could allow Universal or Warner Records to create a playlist in the tool.  Down the road, we'd also think through using artists as an editor namespace (eg, if we wanted to give the ability for individual artists to create and manage their own playlists).  

Unsure that we need to a country admin as providers are country specific.

Need to think through the relationship between brands and providers.  For example, how could the playlist guy at Bell Canada change any playlists of brands from that provider without us having to dole out individual brand permissions.  

Would still need global admins (eg. Kavi) who could adjust anything.

Upon initial rollout, we'd need to batch apply permissions to existing playlists.

Sample User Levels:

# Global Playlist User/Admin - ability to create and adjust all playlists app-wide - both dynamic and manual playlists
# Provider Playlist User - ability to create and adjust all playlists where that provider is an editor - or by any of the brands associated with that provider.  Ability to specify whether these users should be able to manage dynamic playlists and/or manual playlists.
# Record Label Playlist User - ability to create and adjust all playlists where that label is an editor (or, down the road, any artists that are associated with that label). This use case would be manual playlists only
# Market Playlist User- Ability to create and adjust all playlists where that market is an editor, including owned by sites/microsites associated with that market.  Ability to specify whether these users should be able to manage dynamic playlists and/or manual playlists.  (initially, it would be manual playlists only)
# Brand Playlist User - Ability to create and adjust all playlists where that brand is an editor, including those owned by microsites associated with the site brand.   Ability to specify whether these users should be able to manage dynamic playlists and/or manual playlists.  (initially, it would be manual playlists only)

Note, out of scope for this ticket, but to be solved in Q4 is the locale-specific distribution and customization of playlists... eg, which are available in Canada, what needs to be translated, solving tracks that aren't available in a given region.","11/Jul/18 1:43 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Discussed on the phone with George today.

There's two separate components... how we tag playlists - and how we know what to show users.  

Tickets: 

# One for adding editor tagging at the playlist level (first ticket)
# Playlist visibility (both in list and detail view) to only show playlists that a user has access to.  Need to figure out how to show playlists by taxonomy.  Mirror after the current leads setup. (second ticket)
# Taxonomy for Record Labels. Is this in a new taxo bucket, or do we tack on to vendors or providers? (may not be required for MVP)

First two should not be in the same sprint.  3rd may come later.

Questions: 

# If we have an outside user (eg. record rep or Cumulus employee), is there any additional permissioning we need to have to keep them out of other areas - Is support allocating the correct permissions in user manager enough?

Long Term Solution:
1. Extend taxo relationship data to have a name. Names can be either ""bucket:<bucket_name>"" or ""user:<whatever_string>"".
2. ObjectDB should stop using general purpose relationships (unnamed relations) for security. Instead it should limit tag relationship lookup to include the name ""bucket:<bucket_being_accessed>"" or ""bucket:<prefix_of_dotted_bucket_name>"".
3. Taxo application should represent multiple relationships and allow editing of those.

This will give us the ability to maintain separate permission hierarchies per bucket. We cannot do this per application because there is no secure method for determining which application a query is for. With separate permission hierarchies per bucket and with objectdb selecting the current buckets permissions we can more tightly control where the meaningful relationships are.",09/Jul/18 10:48 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Are there followup tickets from this spike that we can link?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, I created a quick add station -TESTGREG-FL, it went into the queue and I approved it, then when i went to search it it did not return. I had to find by Mike's method.

I think what we need is a list of rules for these calendar events. Content items have a set of editors on them which is carried over to the event. Since content allows you to read any piece of content no matter who created it, this creates an issue where some of the editor tags may not belong to the user creating the event.","24/May/18 1:54 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;This event?  http://calendar.radioedit.iheart.com/#/edit/59bc0d4c8c13998c07cc10fc

it looks like WBZY-FM is the editor group, so i would expect anyone with permission to that brand could edit/delete the event.  

Might be worth allowing additional editors to be added from within the calendar tool- that way if a content item is brought in that the calendar editor doesn't have permission for, they can add a permission to the actual event so they could edit later.  Block saving if current user doesn't have permission to any of the currently tagged editors (with appropriate error message shown to users?)

Should we also check permissions within the tool to ensure that non-premissioned users can't make changes?  If multiple occurrences were saved by a user that didn't have permission to make a change, that's a little troubling.  ","24/May/18 2:13 PM;AlexMamut@iheartmedia.com;# I understand that anyone with WBZY-FM should be able to edit/delete the event, and that's how it works now.
# Adding editors is a good idea but doesn't solve the main issue. You are able to attach ANY piece of content to an event no matter who is able to edit it because of the nature of content tool. People without permissions to edit the content can still view it. When the content is attached to the event, calendar tool is carrying over the edit permissions from the piece of content to the event. But its setting these as both read and write. So a user can create an event, attach a piece of content they don't have permission to edit, save the event and then its lost to them forever because they can no longer access it.
# No one without permissions to edit an event can even see the event so that's fine.","29/May/18 10:18 AM;AlexMamut@iheartmedia.com;Went over this with Mike, after trying to attach content which has editor tags that user doesn't have access to tool displays save error. So user should not be able to lose visibility of event after saving with bad tags.

Looking further into production issue where occurrences lost members, I could not find a way that this would occur unless there was an objectdb issue.

I'm not sure I can update any code which would help with this issue.","30/May/18 8:55 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;As there's no user reports of this happening attached to the ticket and there's no clear engineering approach to take, I'm going to close this out as unsolvable.

Versioned binaries are stored based on a hash of the contents of the file. If we change working copies to also be based a hash of the file, then we can combine the three environments into a single S3 bucket and not have to store 3 copies of 1.3T of data. This will also make copying data between environments easier because we can copy the DB references from prod to stage/dev without having to copy the S3 resources.

In order to prevent orphaned binaries from accumulating, this feature would also require a database collection to track reference counts for binaries. Any time a binary is saved to S3, we would increment the reference count. When a new binary is uploaded to an existing resource, we would decrement the old reference count. A periodic task can look for 0-count binaries and remove them from S3.

1. Create a new service to manage S3 binaries and reference counts.
2. Update objectdb to use the new service to manager reference counts when binary data is attached to a resource.

From Dave Basner: So for most stories I do, I need to include many topics. I have a preset for it. Sometimes the stories i do fit in weird news while other times they are entertainment news, so that is typically the only topic I add. While that topic should be the catchall one, because putting it at the top would require me to delete all the others then re-add them after entering the catch-all topic, it winds up not being at the top. Then what happens is stories that should be a category in particular, and correctly fall into that category on the home page feed, show the wrong topic on the article level (see screen shots).

{quote}Google News Sitemaps
Much more so than general XML Sitemaps for Web Search, Google News XML Sitemaps are critical for competing in Google News. Creating and maintaining a Google News sitemap is one of the most important factors in Google News success. The Google News Sitemap is based on the XML sitemap, but has additional news-specific tags.
iHeart struggles to compete for Google News traffic. Part of the reason for this is that its news content is hard to discover. Google News crawling and indexation is known to be much more frustrating than its Google Search cousin, making it critical to lead it to the right content.

Protocol documentation:
https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html

we want all of the hrefs for two different things:
# all content whose origin is the site
# all content whose origin is the microsite for every microsite whose primary-site is the site

The API will likely be an rpc call that lives in site manager. It has the data needed to find the content, and it has the brains to generate canonical urls. This differs from the timeline query in that it *only* cares about content whose origin is the site. We aren't doing the general-purpose timeline query. 

Since there is a limit of 50K urls per sitemap, we will use what's called a sitemap index to list each sitemap, and then create a sitemap for each day for which a site has published content.

There is debate on whether or not we should calculate the sitemap live and cache it, or calculate it offline and store it somewhere. Do some performance testing on the query to see what response times look like before building the entire solution. This needs to be exposed via fire, which does not do any rpc calls today.

Pubsub does not calculate any fields today, so we would need to modify the publish call in content.

Looks good to me.  ,21/May/18 8:46 AM;MarkCahill@iheartmedia.com;I suspect that the proposed solution doesn't meet the goal. It seems like you would want web to pass in the site the content item is being displayed on in order to test if it matches the publish origin. I would think that original content only published on a non-flagship site _would_ have amp enabled?,"21/May/18 9:26 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;The goal is to only have the amphtml link present when content is viewed on the canonical domain.  Google has been confused by the ""mixed signals"" (as our SEO consultant put it) by having each site promote an AMP page on each site the page is viewed on.  While we could update these amphtml link values to always use the canonical location, that wouldn't work for stations sharing content via social media (notably twitter who uses the AMP pages frequently) as the shared page would not be in the station's brand - and thus the station wouldn't get credit for the traffic.

The solution was then to only populate an amphtml link when content is viewed on its canonical domain.  If viewed elsewhere, Twitter would not see the AMP link and would just return the regular version of the content page.

This functionality is already in production on the local sites via AL-4193 - this ticket is just so that iHeart.com knows whether to show an amphtml link or not.  
","21/May/18 9:29 AM;MarkCahill@iheartmedia.com;Yeah, I don't think this accomplishes that goal. The logic that I've implemented based on the description of the ticket is to only show the amp link if a national site was the original publish origin. Amp will still be enabled on every site that syndicates this content.","21/May/18 10:32 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Hmmm, that's not currently the case in production:

[A/B tests admin GUI] new creation API and workflow,IHRAR-3844,613747,,Story,Completed,AR,Completed,YehudaRosen@iheartmedia.com,KailuoWang@iheartmedia.com,KailuoWang@iheartmedia.com,3/2/18 15:09,8/7/18 8:52,7/19/18 14:19,2018.7.31,,AB Tester,,,,,,"Current the GUI uses two endpoints to create / replace new tests 
1. *PUT tests/* used by ""REPLACE tests""
2. *POST tests/*  used by ""Create tests""
But the PUT endpoint will not allow a user to create a new revision of a test that is scheduled after the last test ends, in which case user will have to use Create test functionality but it could be cumbersome and error prone to the settings from the existing test. 

I created a new endpoint *POST tests/auto* that can be used combined with the *POST tests/* to enable a new unified workflow for test creation/replace. (This new endpoint will be deployed to staging soon)
The swagger doc of the new *POST test/auto* is here http://stg-abtest.ihrcloud.net/docs/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/assets/swagger.json#/routes/createAuto

So here is the new workflow that should be used for both test creation and replacement, this new workflow has multiple steps. 

step 1, gui uses ""POST tests/"" to post the data of the test to be created. (same as the current create new test action)

step 2, gui gets the response from server. If the response is 200 OK then creation succeeded, no further action needed, if the response status is 409 (means conflict), GUI should display a confirmation modal window, asking if the user wants to terminate the existing conflict test (whose information will be given in the response json body). if the user choses no, creation should be aborted, otherwise go to step 3.
If the response status is either 409 or 200, gui should display the error message and abandon the creation. 

step 3, if the user choose to proceed with terminating conflict test, GUI should use a different endpoint to post the same request, this time it should use ""POST tests/auto"", go to step 2


The ""Create Replacement"" button should use the same workflow above as create a new test. The ""PUT tests/"" should be no longer used by the GUI. 

Also ""Create Replacement"" label should be renamed to ""New Revision"".

Based on how we're currently handing these XML feeds (see comments below for my review with Alex), if there's an article published to all 120 stations' feeds, we're ingesting it on the first one we see it on; and then because that article is already in the system, it's getting skipped on the other 119 feeds as a duplicate.  As such, only 1 of 120 stations gets the desired content.

If it find that the same combination is already in place, it sees it as duplicate content and does skips.

What's happening here is that the Canadian stations are including identical content as per the above criteria in multiple XML feeds.  It's getting ingested on the first station it sees it on, and then skipping the rest.  

Depending on how prevalent this is, we'll likely need to explore ways to either allow duplicate content to be ingested - or perhaps if a piece of duplicate content is found from the same vendor, upon processing the second or subsequent instance, it instead applies an additional brand/topic tag to the existing content item.  ",12/Mar/18 9:40 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Converted ticket into a spike to determine best way to facilitate ingestion of 3rd party content where the same article should be distributed to multiple brands.,"15/Mar/18 1:23 PM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;If we want to keep the content unique in the system (we do), and if we want to have separate feeds setup for groups of stations within the ingestion tool (seems like we do) then what this is is a change in behavior when a duplicate is detected.

If this is already within the content system, instead of saving it again update the targeting then re-publish.

So when these duplicate feeds get run over, the Bell stations will be augmented with the publishing parameters in the ingestion config.","16/Mar/18 9:51 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Another element that Rob and I discussed... each canada station has its own branded website, and they want their version of the content to open on the detail page that has the station's branding.  Very similar to what we're solving in IHRAR-3804 where we want national articles featured on iHeart.com to open in the station's website.","21/Mar/18 6:23 PM;MattBrown@iheartmedia.com;Feed content should be considered distinct if the same date and title haven't appeared for that feed.  A way forward would be to change how ingested articles are stored, where the resource id is a hash of feed config id (or some other identifier for the feed), publish date from the feed, and title. No content api change would be required.","22/Mar/18 9:52 AM;MattBrown@iheartmedia.com;A potential issue with any fix that allows the same article on multiple feeds to be ingested: if the slug and date are the same across multiple feeds, then the content create API will fail to publish all but one of them. Content's create API should do a pre-check before auto-publishing and respond with 400 if the slug is in use, then ingest would have to alter it with a random string or some such.","11/Apr/18 11:50 AM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;The only feasible way that we can think of to do this is to implement the following:

1. Do not de-dupe content from different feeds based on slug.
2. Prefix or Affix text onto the slug generated from all ingested feeds to make them unique per feed.
3. Publish all content from all feeds into pubsub.

The thing to look out for here is that we'll have 100+ copies of the same article inside of the content system. Additionally, if ingestion publish settings between two feeds were to ever overlap you would see duplicate entries in a station's timeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems that the external URL field is not the correct value to use here as that's only available for content that was imported from a 3rd party.  Need to dig into this some more before pulling into a sprint.  ,22/Feb/18 9:33 AM;MarkEscott@iheartmedia.com;[~ccrnyc1rar]?,"22/Feb/18 10:29 AM;RobRowe@iheartmedia.com;If the RE team would like to do it a different way, that's fine, but adding an external_url is currently the only way www.iheart.com will link out to an external URL instead of displaying the content in www.iheart.com.","05/Mar/18 3:28 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;It sounds like there are three use cases we need to solve for:

# O&O station that has its own website where content should open on that station's site.  Example: Z100
# O&O Digital Channel that does NOT have a website and content should open on www.iheart.com or news.iheart.com.  Example: Hit Nation
# 3rd Party station where a content reference is ingested that should open on the 3rd party site.  Example: CHUM-FM

Assuming the above is correct, we currently deliver on #2 and #3 but not #1.  

I don't know if there's any differentiation in Site Manager between #1 and #2, I think historically that difference has been made on the iHeart.com side based on the website value returned from SMT... for stations that don't have a site, the website is set as news.iheart.com.  

Likewise, i don't know that there's a differentiation between O&O stations and 3rd party stations in Site Manager... but on the SMT side, the provider is Clear Channel vs Bell Media.  However, i suppose it's possible that content created on RadioEdit could eventually be published to a 3rd party site (eg, and article about Festival).

Concurrently, we know there is an ask from the Advanced Product Marketing team to start leveraging an external URL for ingested partner content to override the canonical link tag throughout the platform, so I don't believe that basing the WebAPI logic on that field is the way to go.

I think we need a switch in either SMT or Site Manager that allows selection of how to handle external content, either to open on the linked FiRE site, or at the external URL. (content without an external URL could always use a link constructed through the domain from SMT and the slug from WebAPI.)  I could see arguments for doing it in either of those tools.  SMT could be the logical place since it's something iHeart.com specific, primarily to support 3rd party sites... but that would require the addition of logic to iHeart.com since they pull SMT data from AMP and not via WebAPI.  Likewise, Site Manager could be the best place to do it because the links could be constructed by the API... but that arguably is not a ""site"" function since the stations that use it don't have proper sites... which could potentially create additional overhead in the tool and FiRE that the bulk of sites wouldn't leverage.

Does SM contain O&O stations without a website? If not, we could do this:

{code}
1. Pull requested content items from pubsub
    a. Check for external_url, if present copy to ""permalink"" datapoint.
    b. Check for site manager record
        1. if exists copy canonical url to ""permalink"" datapoint.
        2. if missing either leave blank or generate an iheart.com link and add it to ""permalink""
{code}

Then web can key off ""permalink"" always.","16/Mar/18 9:47 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;There are O&O stations that don't have a dedicated website, they currently have an SM site for purposes of populating the live profile on iHeart.com - but no user-facing website.  At the moment, SMT is used to cue iHeart.com to generate links to www.iheart.com/news.iheart.com to view content.

Example:

http://stream-manager.radioedit.iheart.com/#/streams/4422
https://www.iheart.com/live/hit-nation-4422/

Could this maybe key off of whether a site is active/inactive?  If active, use the primary domain setup in Site Manager - if inactive, use www.iheart.com/news.iheart.com.  I THINK that mirrors the logic built on the local ticket to deactivate sites... SMT returns the site data regardless, and then fire looks for the active/inactive switch to know whether to show the site or redirect to iHeart.com.","16/Mar/18 11:19 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;New checkbox/radio/dropdown in Partners>iHeartRadio for ""iHeart.com Editorial Links"" (Help Text: ""Specify whether content shown on this site's iHeart.com profile page opens on iHeart.com or on the station site"")

The issue was that non admin accounts would save an event which would add the proper permissions onto the event / occurrences.

Until we build a full blown solution in SMT for the long term, we need a script to provision and manage Pivot HLS urls in SMT for the short term.  Pivot Beta goes live *March 26*, so need a way to manage HLS urls for a list of streams, which [~kchoe] will provide.

Pivot HLS urls should be formatted as follows:

1.   Use this prefix: https://us.api.iheart.com/api/v3/adswizzhls/redirect.m3u8?url=  (if in stage, use:  http://us-stg.api.iheart.com/api/v3/adswizzhls/redirect.m3u8?url=)

2.  Take the stations existing HLS url, and URL encode it.  E.g.  https://c7.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com/2153/playlist.m3u8 would look like: https%3A%2F%2Fc7.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com%2F2153%2Fplaylist.m3u8

3.   Add #1 and #2 together to get: https://us.api.iheart.com/api/v3/adswizzhls/redirect.m3u8?url=https%3A%2F%2Fc7.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com%2F2153%2Fplaylist.m3u8

4.   Append the marketId.  E.g.  WBUT-FM is in market 210:  &marketId=210. The resulting final URL is:  https://us.api.iheart.com/api/v3/adswizzhls/redirect.m3u8?url=https%3A%2F%2Fc7.prod.playlists.ihrhls.com%2F2153%2Fplaylist.m3u8&marketId=210

Some notes:

# Please do the match on legal call sign, which is in the first column (don't match on slug!)
# Do NOT import if site slug ends in -HD
# Please generate a list of any legal call signs for which a match could not be made upon import
# At end of the import, for any sites that are missing a value, set to the corresponding Site Name value.","12/Feb/18 6:00 PM;AdamRoberts@iheartmedia.com;The ""call signs"" present in the updated doc contain duplicates, for example KABQ. I think I also need the broadcast bands.","13/Feb/18 11:46 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;I've removed the dupes, this was a result of a bad data import from T2.  I've been cleaning these up in the tool as I activate public files, the ones on the previous list were ones I hadn't gotten to as of when I did the export to generate this list in december.  I've updated the values in the spreadsheet and have also updated in prod SM.  As a result, since dev/stage data is dated, there may be some mis-matches in the non-prod environments.

You shouldn't need the broadcast band... you'll want to key off of this value:

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

You MAY find dupes in SM for the legal call sign field... but those should only be in cases of HD2 stations, which we are excluding via note #2 above.  HD2 stations are intentionally removed from the csv.  ","20/Feb/18 8:55 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Reviewed on dev.  SPot checked about a dozen stations, both AM, FM, and HD, and all the stations had a value to be inserted look good.

However, found an issue with sites that did not have a value in the CSV having the value of ""Master"" for each of the pronouncer fields.  For sites that don't have pronouncer values, these fields should be populated with the site name.

Examples:

In this case ""www.sportsradiokjr.com"". The links are using https and we do not have ssl certs for all station website domains. This should be fixed in one of three ways:

1) update all streams in SMT to define their website using their actual iheart.com domain such as sportsradiokjr.iheart.com. https protocol works for those.
2) hard-code the links on the station's stream profile page to use http instead of https. FiRE and Fastly will handle all appropriate redirects to the secure station website from there, avoiding the browser's privacy warning message.
3) www.iheart.com should look up the station data by the connected RadioEdit brand in SMT and pull the primary station's URL from there. that would account for any domain changes the station makes in the future.

I think the quick fix would be to do suggestion #1 above, a bulk import of all the current station primary domains and then ensure they get updated on an ongoing basis for future changes.

Long term, #3 is definitely the way to go.  We should only use a domain value provided in SMT if there is no associated FiRE site.

*+Publishing content‚Ä¶ how do i‚Ä¶+*

# Publish to a homepage regardless of whether a station has subscribed to a particular topic _(Use @home placement in the distribution field in addition to the actual brands/segments)_
# Publish to a homepage only if a station has subscribed to a particular topic _(Select topics plus distribution)_
# Publish only to a microsite for all stations that the microsite has been distributed to? note: microsites don't currently have topic restrictions _(Brand is the microsite‚Ä¶ no topic needed)_
# Publish only to a microsite for a subset of stations that have the microsite _(Brand of microsite PLUS brand of parent sites that should get the content)_
# Publish to both the station homepage and the microsite homepage for all stations that have the microsite _(Need to give this some thought. No clear path at the moment)_
# Publish to both the station homepage and the microsite homepage for a subset of stations that have the microsite _(Ditto above, need to give it some thought)_
# Publish something that shouldn't appear on the site or microsite homepage (Solved by new content tool strategy- excluded from timeline)

*+Setup‚Ä¶ how do stations‚Ä¶+*

* Opt in/out of topic subscriptions? _(Need to give this some thought. How can stations select which topics they do or don't want  - eg. News talk stations that doesn't want soft news. How to do the queries in a way that doesn't kill site manager. Do we initially launch without topic selection on homepages? How would we weed out content rules that need a topic but shouldn't show up there?)_

Downside: This will require a significant investment in engineering time to change publishing systems (content, pubsub, site-manager)","07/Mar/18 8:35 PM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;h3. Concept 
The concept on the surface is one of a ""what"" and a ""where"" model.

All items destined for publishing (source) will have zero or more ""whats"", and zero or more ""wheres"".

Whats are things like Topic/Category tags, possibly artist tags and any special tags we decide on for publishing use cases.

Wheres are things like Z100, NEWYORK or A_SEGMENT. They can be specific brands or any tag that represents a group.

Queries or Subscriptions defined in site manager (destination) will follow the same model of What and Where.

The Where tags will be able to be combined with boolean logic. For example, you could say ""(Z100 and Ryan Seacrest) or WKTU"".

h3. Implementation

Content will provide an updated What/Where based interface and a component that allows boolean expressions when selecting tags.

Pubsub will resolve any arbitrarily nested set of boolean expressions to a flat list of strings.

Pubsub will also expand any group tags that come in as the Where. For markets, this means expanding to all sites in that market, for segments it's the same thing. This can generate an enormous amount of possible destinations but since we're just storing it as a plain string array it shouldn't be bad even with several thousand sites.

Site manager will create a data sources editor which follows the same pattern of What/Where. 99% of SM queries should be one or two fixed concepts and require little in the way of change. Additionally, the search list should come down from 250+ to 2-3 which would essentially turbocharge the query system performance wise.

h3. Work

Significant changes to content, pubsub and site manager would be needed. Along with migrations and some new UI components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I put 2 checkboxes vs 1 so that the RE playlist tool user is forced to confirm whether the playlist is premium or not. I figured this approach demands more intent from the user than a singular box that defaults to ""no"" if user overlooks it and forgets to check it to mark the playlist as premium. I suppose the consequence of a user forgetting to check that box is just that a premium playlist will be made accessible to free users, and only a handful songs will be playable before playback stops.

It's the only boolean option that doesn't match the way we display all the other boolean options.  We let everything else have a reasonable default, whether on or off, and present it as a toggle.  If you're afraid of playlists being non-premium by default, then let's just make the default premium, which would prevent that issue from occurring.  As it stands, it makes for awkward UI.

1) Are the swaps immediately applied to the dynamic playlist?  As in, the knowledge of the base track is gone, and only the swapped track is left, so there's no way to see that it is a swap?

1.) I was hoping the track swap would be immediately applied to the dynamic playlist Track Builder window, and then be applied to the front-end upon playlist publication. 
2.)

Possible to look in that [~gvilches]?","08/May/18 11:29 AM;GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com;That‚Äôs just a quirk of behavior in the UI not forcing swaps immediately.

One controls how long fastly cached images before hitting the origin server. The other expiration is the public expiration given to browsers. This controls how long the browser will reuse an image before hitting fastly again. In media server, the fastly expiration is 14 days, and the public expiration is 6 hours. A browser will hit fastly every 6 hours looking for an update to the image, and fastly will continue returning the same image for 14 days before asking the origin. If we need to preemptively expire an image from fastly we can purge it. The maximum time a browser would continue to use the purged image is 6 hours.","05/Apr/19 10:46 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Re-tested on above link today.  Still getting an ""F"".
