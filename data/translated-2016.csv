3 examples to test against, assuming we'd be setting the height/width on the ops to 780:

Big image - horizontal: http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/584715667be987cb880b59d0 - the larger side (width) of this image would get scaled down to the max of 780 which would result in the height returning at ~520px.

Small Image: http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f - this is smaller than the height/width that we are scaling to, and should neither be scaled up nor have white space added.

1. Some button that ""imports"" the week's playlists from the DynamoDB staging area.
2. ALL dynamic playlists (not just the ones previously edited) are loaded into RadioEdit ObjectDB. We can either create new versions of the resources every week, or only keep the latest version.
3. Any edits that need doing are done.
4. There is an ""export"" button that sends the week's playlists to the DynamoDB ""ready for AMP"" area.

So, definitely thinking there needs to be an interface with DynamoDB here, also think perhaps we were prematurely optimizing by suggesting we only store the playlists that were edited in RadioEdit","15/May/18 12:15 PM;GabeMiller@iheartmedia.com;This was completed awhile back, marking as done",,,,,,,,,

Also [~gvilches], for the playlist-level indicator - would it be possible to have the indicator in the Playlist List view instead of in the Tracklist view? That way a user can quickly scroll through the list of playlists and visually see which ones may be affected by OD-status. I attached a screengrab of that concept","26/Jan/17 8:47 PM;GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com;The fix for that should be deployed in staging.

As far as the playlist-level indicator, it's a bad idea in the app *today*.  Specifically, it's because we don't have enough data from AMP to do so efficiently.  To find out whether a playlist would trip the OD flag, we have to fetch all the playlist tracks from AMP, iterate through that list and see if any are missing their OD flag.  We'd have to do this on app load for every playlist in the list (or at minimum all the visible ones).

If we could get that information from AMP as part of fetching the playlists/collections without a full track details hit, in a single request, then it would be doable.  Theoretically, we could also have a process that runs every N minutes (or whatever interval/timing makes sense) and updates this information in some other caching store, so it would be mostly right most of the time when the list is fetched, and could be updated with freshest data when someone clicks on the tracks, but this adds infrastructure to the playlists app that isn't currently there.  I'm not against it, but I'll want someone else's buy-in to confirm we're willing/worthwhile to go that far. :)  My vote's still for OD-flag AMP support.
","27/Jan/17 10:55 AM;GabeMiller@iheartmedia.com;Got it, thanks for the explanation [~gvilches]. The bug Uzmina found is looking fixed up to me. And I will bring your concern about the playlist-level OD indictor to the AMP team and see if we can get a solution. Otherwise, this ticket is looking good to me.

http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky
because it's not supported in Chrome, this issue is only a problem on iOS until Chrome 56 is released.

At first I thought this was related to the sticky element:
http://codepen.io/davidbarratt/pen/QdypqJ
but upon further investigation, it appears that the edit modal is _behind_ the ""Radio Edit"" header as well (it should be above it like it is on desktop).

I attempted to edit the z-index of the edit modal as well as all of it's parents, but because of [stacking context|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context] it's impossible to get the edit modal to be over save bar and Radio Edit header:
http://codepen.io/davidbarratt/pen/EZPmdo

The Media Attachment modal seems to work properly. I believe this is because it's modal is a direct descendant of the {{<body>}}.

What we need to do is make the edit modal a modal like the attachment modal (where they would both be direct descendants of the body).",10/Jan/17 3:27 PM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;We have a solution for this now but it's out of scope of the ticket. Requires new story with more points.,,,,,,,,,

1)  Full width image - a full width hero-style image is provided, fading out to a solid color on the sites.  Image assets will be layed out so that no maniupulation of the image is necessary and that text is overlaid by the template (text handling is not part of the image scaling)

[3:57 PM] Trey Long: what do they add
[3:57 PM] Trey Long: I'll try it
[4:00 PM] Adam Howell: Trey he says when he initially added the collection and hit publish that is what happened, but when he re-added them and published it worked
[4:00 PM] Adam Howell: so nevermind, we are back where we started
[4:00 PM] Adam Howell: untill we have someone there who knows the publish process looking over their shoulders it will be hard to track.

[4:01 PM] Trey Long: we're adding additional logging and error reporting to things, but it's slow
[4:17 PM] Adam Howell: ok I just watched as he tried to do this...
[4:18 PM] Adam Howell: he does add collections, he gets an error, the 404 in the network tab is the T2 publish one, which is because the export api is returning a 404
[4:18 PM] Adam Howell: if he stays on the page the collections are still in the box, but if he clicks on the content it does not show it as published and it no longer has the collections
[4:20 PM] Trey Long: so it's a publish failure
[4:21 PM] Trey Long: because the content isn't in the publish API
[4:21 PM] Trey Long: is this some sort of sync/cache issue?
[4:21 PM] Adam Howell: so seems to be some sort of race condition maybe. Is the content tool waiting on the flint-service to respond 200 in order to mark something as published? But the flint service needs it to be published to display at this url http://content.radioedit.iheart.com/api/v1/export/content/by-id/
[4:21 PM] Trey Long: it's odd that it somehow rolls back...
[4:22 PM] Trey Long: I wouldn't think so
[4:22 PM] Trey Long: we should fully commit the publish and then notify you

This makes passing 'fit(width,height)' operation position sensitive. Adding 'fit' BEFORE 'run' discards the fit operation and creates a 400x400 image no matter what. Adding 'fit' AFTER 'run' creates the correct size image, but wrong image quality because first 'run(""od"")' operation is processed on a 400x400 image and then scaled to the size specified in 'fit'. In this case if 'fit' has a bigger size than 400x400, the image is upscaled and image ends up pixelated, bad quality. 'run(""od)' should not always be processed on a 400x400 image.

Whenever we have images that take many iterations to complete (long op chains) it can really slow things down. I can uncap this limit, but out of curiosity what is the maximum resolution you would require for this type of image? Also, would it be reasonable to expect that a fit() operator always be applied first that matches the need for that placement?","10/Jun/16 10:03 AM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;Also, as far as placing fit(100,100) first and getting a crappy image, that *IS* a bug. Internally I use fit() when I should be using max()","10/Jun/16 12:44 PM;FerhatOzduran@iheartmedia.com;[~tlong] 400x400 actually works for majority of our users. But when we need bigger images in iPads and iPhone 6 Plus, it looses sharpness. Biggest image we'll request is 600x600 from iPhone 6 Plus (3x Retina screen). iPad Pro will be requesting 500x500. So I am thinking if we can raise the default 400x400 to 600x600 without much hit to performance, that will solve our sharpness problem.","10/Jun/16 12:48 PM;FerhatOzduran@iheartmedia.com;About respecting the order of 'fit' vs 'run' bug, I will fix it on client side with this ticket https://jira.ccrd.clearchannel.com/browse/AIOS-3396 by putting 'fit' after 'run' and we should be good for Artist Profile launch. This we don't have to prioritize this ticket before launch.

But keep in mind I had to move all fit operations to last before we released Artist Profile as a workaround for the issue I wanted to fix with this ticket. If I didn't move fit to last, some images were showing blurry since run operation was making the images 400x400 no matter what fit operation I passed before run.

So here, RadioEdit not making sure to run ""fit"" first is bringing an issue with the prod deployment of this fix you have in staging.
Current App Store 6.4 build has ""run,fit"", and assume I made our next 6.5 build ready with ""fit,run"".

1. If you deploy to prod now, 6.4 users will hit costly image server requests until we release 6.5 and adoption reaches a good level.
2. If we release 6.5 before you deploy to prod, 6.5 users will hit costly requests until you deploy to prod. Plus, in this case, the blurry Artist Profile images I fixed fit ""run,fit"" workaround comes back until deployment to prod. But we can disregard the blurry issue if image server's survival against costly requests is the matter.

One solution I can think of is making RadioEdit run ""fit"" first, no matter what position it's at, but I believe you want the order to matter.

What do you guys think?
",27/Jul/16 3:13 PM;FerhatOzduran@iheartmedia.com;Passing fit before other operations is ready to be merged here https://jira.ihrint.com/browse/AIOS-3766,03/Aug/16 3:58 PM;TreyLong@iheartmedia.com;We can't automatically mess with the order of operations because it changes the result. I think if we pushed the fix ahead of your release while the cache is still warm it will be the least impactful. A change in references for image loading across the mobile client is going to cause a deluge of requests anyway.,,

We would:
* Not allow publishing to FB if the content contains an HTML block
* Transform a subset of other block types into the HTML5 spec provided by FB when publishing there
* Allow for compliant text, image and video content to be published to FB
* Change the UI of content a bit accordingly, and find the right place to integrate the FB page/token piece
* Implement publishing to FB

We could:
* Add FB page-level (not article level) aggregated stats of views/scrolls (something to ponder during Hack Week when looking at analytics)

High level ballpark is this is a Large aka 2 man sprint effort, and can be broken into two pieces. The first is to make the content editor compliant with our desired end result. The second is to add the FB token and publishing bits. Then perhaps look at analytics afterwards.",,,,,,,,,,

Adswizz can be configured to skip ad insertion for breaks shorter than 30 secs.  Since Adswizz does not have ads less than 30 seconds, any ads inserted into a short breaks (e.g. 10 secs) would not fit and cause the break to run long into music (which listeners hate).  

Need to implement the ""short break filter"" in Adswizz configs to skip any breaks less than 30 secs.   This involves changes in two locations:

*CHANGE 1*
ONLY FOR EDGE mount configs, the field *<query-timeout-in-milliseconds>* needs to change value from *3000* to *1500*.  
*(see screenshot attached)*

*CHANGE 2*
ONLY in the MASTER mount config, add the field *<disable-metrics-api>* and set to *1*.
*(see screenshot attached)*

*CHANGE 3*
This applies to BOTH master and edge configs.
*(See file attached + screen shot)*

Change the following two fields:
A.  *match-regex*
{code}
OLD value: .*text=""Spot\sBlock"".*length=""(\d*):(\d*):(\d*).(\d*).*
NEW VALUE
.*text=""Spot\sBlock"".*length=""(?:([1-9]\d):(\d\d):(\d\d).(\d\d)|(0[1-9]):(\d\d):(\d\d).(\d\d)|(00):([1-9]\d):(\d\d).(\d\d)|(00):(0[1-9]):(\d\d).(\d\d)|(00):(00):([3-9]\d).(\d\d)).*

Adam Howell	4:28 PM
ok shoot
Trey Long	4:28 PM
How will the local/national ad split manifest in the HTML, do you know?
is it querystring var or something?
Adam Howell	4:30 PM
it is
let me give you the real world example
Trey Long	4:30 PM
awesome
Adam Howell	4:30 PM
well not query string
I'll show you the url of the call is slightly different
Trey Long	4:31 PM
we're discussing how to include ad placement config into regions in site manager. Next question is, will individual placements ever need to change their national/local split or is it site wide? Additionally, will you want to swap out position IDs per site or override certain placements with new ids for A/B testing?
Adam Howell	4:36 PM
ccr.newyork.ny in the string if local
if national it looks like ccr.newyork.ny.n
individual placements
let me answer all 3
so the url of the ad call basically has a .n in it if national, so when writing the tag with javascript and it is national add a .n

the overrides need to be individual position/page for instance. I want position 3307, 3330, and 3309 100% national on the homepage

That may be something they want to do, but most of the time a position is tied to the shape of the display ad, so it may be more of a template A/B test and not just an ad A/B test
most of the time it is all ads on 1 page
could ask mike about simplifying it to that.
Trey Long	4:41 PM
it would make it harder for us to unify it
Adam Howell	4:41 PM
then individual is fine that is how it currently is",,,,,,,,,,
