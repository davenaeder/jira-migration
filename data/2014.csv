The two new flags, with their default states, are:

1) Sponsored?	(Yes/No)
	Default State:	No
2) Child-Oriented?	(Yes/No)
	Default State:	No

Examples of the use of these flags include:
- Suppressing ads on a “child-oriented” station page on Web
- Changing the reg. gate rules on a child-oriented page
- Remove the age gate on a child-oriented page
- Suppressing run-of-site ads from a Sponsored station page
- Introducing new ad units on a Sponsored station page

The goal in implementing this is to do so in such a way that a wholesale directory change is not triggered for the mobile clients.  The intent is that no data should change for the majority of stations so only discreet changes should be pushed through for affected stations and not a whole new directory listing.

This 1:1 (square) aspect ratio image will also be used for CarPlay and Android Auto clients by shrinking it down via iScale.

We should add the new images to the right of the existing one on the genre ""detail"" screen, and label the two as follows:

1) “16:9” - the current 16:9-ish rectangle populated by 280x128 px images as of 7/30/14 (we expect to replace this with a bigger image once iPhone is on iScale after 5.2.)

2) “Square” - a 1:1, 600x600 which will be native on Vizio & scaled down for Auto

Additionally, we should change the existing image preview on the genre detail screen to match how it appears in the genre list view and properly reflect its existing 16:9-ish image ratio. The new images should also reflect the image ratios but should be scaled down to the current 100 px max height to fit in the tool.

The new image should contain the same information as the current 280x128 one, positioned to the right side of the preview:

1) Filetype
2) Pixel dimensions
3) “Remove Icon” link

Finally, we should add tags to the images in SMT matching the labels above, so AMP knows which is which and the clients can declare which one they are requesting.

All ""focus"" points should continue to default to the center point as they do with the current image and continue to be adjustable as they are now.

Note- and very important- we can't change the output or call for any existing clients, so we should pass through at minimum the same payload to AMP as at present. Clients that do not specify an image-type tag in their call should get the current existing small image. We must preserve existing functionality so as not to break existing Web and Mobile 5.0+ clients already using these images.
