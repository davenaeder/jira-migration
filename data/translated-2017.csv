If instead, I go to http://localhost:3000/#/edit/580fa045f5a52c3fe3863214?from_list=mine and then replace the objectid, it loads the new article and publish info but keeps the old slug.

","05/Apr/18 8:38 PM;BriannaPhillips@iheartmedia.com;Seeing a couple of things:
# Something that wasn't accounted for was how to handle a logo asset where the dominant color is white, like [DC101|http://i-stg.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/77183e912d69d4059064e8a206eefbf5?ops=run(%22liveplaylist%22)]. Is there a workaround for this at all? Ex. in those situations it would be a #000000 overlay at 65%?
# Agree with Rob in that some of the examples I've pulled up the enlarged logo asset isn't visible--can we try enlarging by 400% instead of 500% and see if that makes a difference? Maybe we're just making it too large. ","05/Apr/18 9:25 PM;GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com;On the blur, I've attached a couple examples.  blur(3), blur(10) and no blur.  Let me know if you like this direction, and which one.
 !blur03.png|thumbnail!  !blur10.png|thumbnail!  !noblur.png|thumbnail! ","05/Apr/18 9:28 PM;GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com;Also, these are using 400% scaling instead of 500%.  For reference, here's the 500% scale.
 !5xscaling.png|thumbnail! ","05/Apr/18 9:33 PM;BriannaPhillips@iheartmedia.com;I think blur(10) works the best to smooth the jagged edges. As for the scaling, I still like 500% over 400%, but only if we can make sure those enlarged logo backgrounds are appearing on all stations. Can we see an example where the primary color is dark, like [HOT 97|https://i-stg.iheart.com/v3/catalog/live/6046?ops=run(%22liveplaylist%22)&stay=1]?","05/Apr/18 9:41 PM;GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com;It doesn't play any better at 400%.  The second image is the gradient over the logo background transformation, and the first shows it in scale reference to the logo that's going to be put over it post-crop, so you can mentally place that in the center and see that the fit is the same, just going to be the solid part of the circle.

","12/Dec/18 2:29 PM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;[~gvilches], can you please provide test instructions?  What ops is used to apply the auto setting?","13/Dec/18 1:19 PM;GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com;There's four modes you can test in:

1) Open any image in Chrome, send no parameters.  It should convert to a WEBP.  Open that same image in Firefox, it should be either JPG or PNG, based on whatever format is more ""efficient"" for it.  (transparency will give you PNG no matter what, otherwise you'll probably get JPG)
2) Open any image with ?ops=format(""webp"") .  In Chrome you'll get a WEBP.  In Firefox you'll get a broken image.  This forces the format, regardless of the browser.
3) Open any image with ?ops=format(""jpeg"") .  Even if it has transparency, it will be forced to JPEG in any browser.
4) GIFs follow roughly the same rules, except a GIF should only ever convert to a WEBP or stay as a GIF.  There shouldn't be a way to make a GIF become non-animated.  Also, it may never convert to a WEBP due to the other various limiters on mediaserver not converting animated GIFS in general.

The following following fields in Site Manager are for FCC-licensed values only:

* Licensed Frequency
* Licensed Call Sign
* Band
* Licensed Facility ID

The aforementioned values MUST correspond to the values associated with the broadcast license and are used for purposes of generating public file links and for various legal reporting.

As the FCC only licenses -AM and -FM stations (because we don't own any TV stations, the ONLY acceptable values for band are -AM, -FM, and (none).  Note that -HD stations are not licensed.  HD stations are secondary channels on the FM license, so in the case of an HD site, the legal callsign and band will always be that of the parent station.  For example, WFLZ-HD, evolution933.iheart.com's Licensed Call sign will be WFLZ and the band will be FM.  

It is desirable and necessary to have a unique station identifier that can be passed into ad tags, analytics tracking, and the like. This value is also used to pull the correct station information on Flagship, as well as for quarterly financial reporting.  On the T2 platform, this was the ""station ID""  which RESEMBLED calls-band, but was not necessarily the same. these station ID's contain 3-6 characters identifying the brand, a dash, and a two character classifier, normally -FM, -AM, -HD, -IP, -DV, -MS, -PR, or -FL.  Upon import from T2 to RadioEdit, these station ID's were mapped to the slug field, however, slug is not currently editable.  

While I understand making a slug editable may be some work, especially to determine what changing said value would break",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

h2. Expected Behavior
After starting fire, set to *record* in your local env, the tests should be run and pass.
Also, during the tests, the json fetches should be stored and when 
fire is again restarted, this time to *playback*, the tests should pass, with 
the json fetches should be from disk. 

h4. Further *Why*
In ci, we are always look for optimizations, since e2e tests are inherently slow.
One need is to defend the test env (on a shared platform *that must be shared*) by storing all the json calls (like the adconfig for site-manager) to local disk. 
Then, a dev can commit those fixtures and tell fire to run *playback* mode in ci.

{code:python}
def _get_config(params, hostname):
    try:
        config_data = run_fetcher_service(""site-manager"", ""/api/v1/config"", params=params, ttl=300, schema=Site.Schema(strict=True))
        # The following line is where the problem starts
        site = SiteConfig(config_data, Config(**config_data[""config""]), g.ad_config, hostname)
        return site
    except InvalidResponseCode as e:
        if e.code == 404:
            raise ConfigNotFound(e.url, e.code, e.content)
        raise ConfigAPIFailure(e.url, e.code, e.content)
{code}

Specifically, the construction of the Config object bombs because marshmallow is set to complain if it does not have: *'google_amp_switch', 'apple_news_switch', and 'facebook_instant_articles_switch'* as specified in General.Schema in *radioedit/modesl/config.py*

So, we get an exception:
*builtins.TypeError*
TypeError: __init__() missing 3 required positional arguments: 'google_amp_switch', 'apple_news_switch', and 'facebook_instant_articles_switch'","19/Sep/17 4:47 PM;WayneSeymour@iheartmedia.com;When *FETCH_MODE=record* ...

The _raw_ config data that is returned from the *run_fetcher_service* call is missing three fields that are needed to construct a Config obj. 
Without these, the code throws as I believe its failing Marshmallow's schema validation.
-- I patched it by simply adding the three fields explicitly in sitemanager.py.

After we get beyond that, the collection blocks fail as the payload variable's contents are a different _shape_ than when run without specifying FETCH_MODE...in _FIRE/radioedit/resolvers/collection.py_","21/Sep/17 10:27 AM;WayneSeymour@iheartmedia.com;Now, that I've debugged beyond the first error by explicitly adding properites that need to be there per Marshmallow (probably a SM problem [missing data, etc]), I've made some actual progress:

Not the solution, but I've discovered that the type of the payload is changing depending whether *FETCH_MODE* is specified.  That sounds bad :)


{code:java}
$ FETCH_MODE=record STATIC_HOST=localhost:5000 fab run

        ### type(payload):
        <class 'list'>

$ STATIC_HOST=localhost:5000 fab run
        ### type(payload):
        <class 'dict'>
{code}

This is from [resolvers/collection.py async def resolve|https://github.com/ihr-radioedit-apps/fire/blob/40e60be193982037151b98ef88ee4dcf0d96b111/radioedit/resolvers/collection.py#L161] ~#L161","22/Sep/17 2:02 PM;WayneSeymour@iheartmedia.com;After working with the guys yesterday on this ([~tlong] and [~tterry]) I'm going forward with modifying the existing src instead of debugging [so that I would only need to change slightly].  

Still not gonna be very much different, but it will have tests this time.

Not because simply adding tests make it better, but its an execution context I've grown to love...that and I can see the status of this capability at a glance, without having to run the whole system.","03/Oct/17 2:11 PM;WayneSeymour@iheartmedia.com;In the end, it came down to [~mbrown] fixing up the cache keys in python side via an environment variable: *TIME_OVERRIDE=1506450212 *
How it runs:
# Run fire in *record mode* with the time stamp
# Run the tests with same timestamp
# Rerun fire in *playback mode*
# Rerun the tests as above

The output should be:
* Zero or more new fixtures (api call recordings)
* Passing tests :)



To run fire and record the test's api calls:
{code:bash}
# Run recordings and test
TIME_OVERRIDE=1506450212 FETCH_MODE=record STATIC_HOST=localhost:5000 HOST_OVERRIDE=evolution933.iheart.com fab run

Since that imageUrl is a production image: https://iscale.iheart.com/catalog/show/25376255 , it's almost for sure going to fail because the IDs won't line up in staging.
","06/Jun/18 4:40 PM;RobRowe@iheartmedia.com;Hey [~gvilches], could you please share an example of Podcast, old and new that works as a sample for us to use to test others? ","11/Jun/18 10:23 AM;GeorgeVilches@iHeartMedia.com;I don't quite follow what old and new constitutes in this case. 

I was able to identify this one as working: https://i-stg.iheart.com/v3/catalog/podcast/24917066 .  It is only incidental that it works, as far as I can tell, because AMP staging has an ID that overlaps with AMP production in this case, so the image URL exists in both places.  I don't consider that a good test, it's just the best test we have given the circumstances of AMP's way of building production image URLs for staging Podcasts.","11/Jun/18 11:38 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Because this is a new endpoint (eg. clients are currently getting the imagery from /show/ which isn't going anywhere in this ticket - and will continue to use them until the clients make the corresponding changes), and George believes the testing abnormalities are environment related, I'm ok signing off without seeing this work for every use case - and think we should go ahead and schedule this for a production release.  

However, in exchange for that, i would like to set the expectation that we'll do more in depth product testing than usual upon deploy to production, if for whatever reason we find this isn't working in prod that we would do a quick fix to address any issues and deploy in the next release window so that we can celebrate this as done.

I would also attach imagemagick's identify signature to the command in a JSON fixture or something.*

Posting this comment here for clarity because ticket details didn't accurately reflect the issue.","12/Jul/17 9:12 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Tested on dev at http://site-manager.dev-radioedit.ihrint.com/#/brands/site/658578cd8ac639c767a6a54cbf16cdf7/Imported/keywords using two different browsers.  Tried adding various overrides on each browser and saving.  

If user 1 and user 2 both have the screen up and are adding overrides... if user 1 has saved new items, then user 2 saves, it will clear out all the overrides that user 1 setup and only show the original items that were initially present and the ones that user 2 added in.  If user 1 then tries to re-save, it will wipe out the items user 2 put in.

[11:13 AM] Alex Mamut: hey Mike
[11:13 AM] Alex Mamut: would you know of an example site which has this issue? https://jira.ihrint.com/browse/IHRAR-2872
[11:14 AM] Mike Woodruff: i think this ticket is a symptom of a larger problem
[11:15 AM] Mike Woodruff: i believe the issue was that if there's two people changing search overrides at the same time that it wipes the changes the other person makes
[11:15 AM] Alex Mamut: ahh ok that makes more sense
[11:15 AM] Mike Woodruff: ideally the save button at the bottom should be eliminated and each change (add/delete) is immediately saved.","13/Jul/17 8:44 AM;MikeWoodruff@iheartmedia.com;Tested search term additions across multiple browsers (for both the microsite and single stations) and found that I was able to add in multiple places at the same time without terms overriding one another.  The addition functionality looks good.

For deletions, locally created overrides can be deleted no problem (as can national overrides be deleted via the master site), however, local sites are now unable to delete national overrides as they could in the previous version. Can we find out what's going on there?  The first three items in http://site-manager.dev-radioedit.ihrint.com/#/brands/site/658578cd8ac639c767a6a54cbf16cdf7/Imported/keywords are from the master site.

This is problematic because auth does not have access to the tags API so it does not know about the ownership hierarchy of tags (observing the namespace allows a user to observe the individual tags).

Consider moving all of the policy-related checks from auth into user manager. User manager can work with the objectdb to check permissions with full tag knowledge, and then contact auth with elevated security to make changes to the user records. In short, auth will handle authentication, and user manager will manage authorization.

This could be the solution to IHRAR-1405.

1. Replicate the necessary parts of the auth api into user manager. All of the user manager UI should use the user manager api. No direct calls to auth.

During this work, we should also update fire to limit the data allowed to be queried from the /api/load_more endpoint. We should not allow arbitrary content queries. It would also be simpler if the load more button took all of its data on the <button> element instead of attaching it to each of the content items.

1. Use a single method for the load-more (specified URL) instead of various other parameters.

One theory I have is that I create a new article, but I did it with the wrong preset. Since Isha has been having issues where editing feeds within in an article doesn‚Äôt always seem to work(she removes a format, but it still shows up on that feed). When I do this, I back out of the article and create a new one. But it seems that sometimes the article goes live.

* category_id
* category_parent_id
* category_name
* category_linkname
* category_description
* is_active

*thmbamw_ingestion.talk.category_map* - Similar to category table above, but adds a field for another ID which is used to map categories to shows.
* category_map_id - Same ID as in talk.category
* mapped_category_id - ID used to map to shows in talk.show_category_link
* provider_category_name
* date_added
* last_updated
* provider_category_linkname

*thmbamw_ingestion.talk.show_category_link*
* show_id - maps show to category. Show IDs primary residence is talk.show
* category_map_id - ID from talk.category_map
* association_weight - No longer in use
* category_id - ID from talk.category. Field exists, but not really necessary.
* sort_order - Numeric value that determines the order shows will be listed within each category. 

Since we still using Postgres as the primary source, I will also need to add an additional field in talk.category for the category sort order (order categories are displayed in front end directories)","10/Apr/17 1:40 PM;NateTobin2@iheartmedia.com;We will also need the option to add an image for each category. The source location for categories will be located in the Postgres table 'Thmbamw_ingestion.talk.category' and the field name will be 'category_image'

This will be required work for Podcasts v4, which includes a redesign of our directory structure. Category Images will be part of that design. ","25/Apr/17 8:33 PM;NateTobin2@iheartmedia.com;I've tested the new category management section in staging (http://customtalk.radioedit.ihrint.com/categories/), including:
* Adding a new category
* Modifying an existing category
* Deleting a category
* De-activating a category
* Sorting the Categories
* Sorting Shows within Categories
* Adding shows to categories
* Removing shows from categories

After some small fixes by[~gvilches], everything related to the tool is behaving as expected!

At this point, we just need to ensure category changes are getting passed to AMP. We also need to ensure images can be added to each category. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
